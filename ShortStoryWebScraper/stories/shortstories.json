    "text": "One bright sunny day Molly went to Sophie’s house for a Sunday play date. “What are we going to play today?” Molly asked. ”How about football? It is the World Cup these days!” And with that they happily skipped to the back yard. They were having a lovely time until the ball hit the magic shed. At that moment Sophie felt a tingle of excitement. ”We haven’t been in the shed for a long time!” Dearest readers, Molly and Sophie have had many adventures in the magical shed but, you see, they had checked several times and hadn’t found any magical signs during the past few weeks.\nMolly ran to the loose plank but slipped on a thick green leaf. Molly and Sophie went into the tunnel when suddenly Sophie said ”The tunnel is getting more humid and tropical leaves are coming on my face. We are probably going to a tropical rainforest!” She had guessed correctly as they passed a wooden sign marked ‘The Amazon rainforest’ and entered the tropical land. ”Molly!” screamed Sophie, “you’re a tiger!” Just then Molly spotted a lake nearby and looked at her reflection and saw a big fury body with black stripes and two cat ears perched on her head!\nA few seconds later they heard footsteps drawing nearer and nearer. Molly and Sophie hid in a big bush close to a patch of trees. The footsteps belonged to loggers. Bit by bit they watched the men cut down the beautiful trees. After the men left ,Sophie asked Molly “Do you think we’re here to stop deforestation?” Molly nodded worriedly. “So first we need to warn the animals…and you should do it” finished Sophie and with that Molly made a loud ”ROOOAR!” ”I will follow the men and find out what they’re doing and who they are.” Sophie told Molly and ran into the trees.\nAfter a few moments, right in front of Molly were fierce tigers, colorful toucans, golden toads and rare pink dolphins in a stream near by. ”Are you OK?” Asked a pink dolphin. “Yes but I saw some men come and cut a beautiful part of the forest. Do you know who they are?” asked Molly. ”They are loggers, people whose job is to cut down trees!” Exclaimed a gold toad. ”And if they keep this up we’ll have no where to live!” Added a tiger.\nSophie was quietly following the men until they stopped in front of a huge tent. Next to the tent there was a large chair with a mean, skinny man on it and he said “Dubai ordered 200kg of wood and you brought 100kg bring 100kg by sunset or else…” Sophie rushed into the forest and said to the men ”You have to stop cutting down trees, it’s hurting the animals that live here!” “Move over girl! We only take orders from our boss.” After that they moved to the next group of trees. Sophie ran to Molly and told her that the loggers weren’t listening. Molly told Sophie about a plan that the animals were going to surround the loggers then Sophie could talk to them and that’s exactly what they did. When the loggers looked to their left there was a patch of trees with angry toucans ready to peck. When they looked to their right, there were growling tigers! And when they thought of jumping into the river behind them there were pink dolphins soaking them from head to toe and finally Sophie in front of them. Suddenly Sophie said “Amazon rainforest is protected. What you’re doing is illegal and if you don’t stop I’ll report you to the police, but I won’t call them if you help us call the Dubai company and tell them what’s going on,” finished Sophie. Some loggers were convinced and immediately took out their phones and told the company that the trees they are getting are from the Amazon Rainforest. Sophie had a great idea and took the phone from one of the loggers and gave the company the idea of making the biggest greenhouse in the whole world since Dubai already has the world’s tallest building and biggest mall. The company immediately agreed because they loved greenery in the desert and the loggers’ boss went to jail.\nThe animals were grateful and and threw a party with tropical fruit like mangoes, dragon fruit, durian, pineapples and bananas and lots of orchid flowers. A tiger gave Sophie and Molly a golden seed to plant at their home as a present. “When it’s a tree, it will have gold leaves” he said. Sophie and Molly happily said thank you and good bye. They went through the tunnel and sat down on their bed for a well earned rest. The next day, they carefully planted their seeds and thought of their Rainforest Adventure.\nWritten by Sofia Omer (8 years old)"

    "title": "The Adventures of Sprinkles The Cat; The King",
    "author": "Macy Claire",
    "text": "Imagine if you will, a kingdom built upon a far away shore. A kingdom where the streets were lined with precious gems that scattered the sunlight onto all of the houses within its borders. The waters crashing gently against the cliffside as though the two were dancing. The most beautiful place imaginable. The kingdom of Nepeta Cataria, home of cats. This is where our story takes place.\nKing Tom ruled the land with an iron fist. He was a ferocious and fierce king, who cared more about the kingdoms beauty than those who resided within its borders. He was on a mission to claim all lands near and far, without a second thought of the lives he may be putting in danger.\nHis army was the largest in feline history, but in the end they were no match for the kind hearted warrior known across the lands as Sprinkles the cat. With his calming purr, and his loving gaze, he could make even the most dedicated soldiers leave in peace. Mothers no longer cried in the streets waiting for the safe return of their children. Everywhere he went, he brought peace and tranquility with him. He was truly a kindred spirit, wise beyond his years.\nOne night as the king sat down for his dinner, he heard the news that a cat had become more widely known and respected than him and this infuriated him. “I order that you capture this cat and throw him in the dungeon! Who does he think he is? This is my land!” Said the king.\nSo the soldiers were sent out with a new mission. To capture Sprinkles, dead or alive. After months of training, they were confident they could do it. But as each troop of men went out, they never returned. As this continued, the king only got more infuriated. His people were tired, hungry, wounded. They lived in fear of Sprinkles, as their loved ones left and never returned home. They were losing hope of ever seeing them again.\nThen on one faithful day, cats were seen marching upon the horizon towards the kingdom. Not just any cats, all of the missing soldiers. But they no longer spread a message of violence. They learned from Sprinkles the ways of kindness and generosity. And they had set out, spreading the message to all that would listen. As they spilled out into the streets and were reunited with their families, the kingdom rejoiced. Their meows could be heard from miles away as they hugged and licked each other. Sons and fathers together again.\nEveryone was elated. Well, almost everyone. The king was mad. His plans had all been foiled. Hearts as black and cold as his would take time to fix. His own soldiers broke into his castle, pulled him from his throne, and threw him in the dungeon. The death sentence was typical under his reign, but his fate was yet to be decided.\nThe kingdom voted that the crown should go to Sprinkles The Cat, their savior, and now their king. As he grew older he married, and had kittens. He taught them, along with the kingdom, that kindness always wins. He said “Let it be known that even when a battle is lost and material things are gone, the kindness in a person’s heart is the most valuable treasure of all.”\nAs for the former king, he spent time in the dungeon, but was eventually released on the condition that he be declawed and attend a six week anger management course followed by therapy for the duration of his life.\nThe End"

Having damaged her left wing and leg, which had been crushed under the wheels of a car, Lucy could not fly. So, the whole day, she sat perched on Max’s back and the dog carried her to places, where food was available, like the roadside dustbins and parks.\nThe two friends were happy in each other’s company and loved and respected each other.  \nThe other animals, in the neighborhood, also appreciated this queer friendship and always encouraged it. However, disaster struck one day, with the advent of the monsoons. The entire area was flooded. As a result, men and cattle died and houses were ravaged and vegetation was destroyed. Sick and cold, Lucy and Max decided to leave the area and move to a new place. Carrying Lucy on his back, Max trudged along the road, stopping only at night to rest.\nEventually, they came to a new town, where the people were rich and dustbins and roadsides were always littered with food. Max and Lucy decided to stay and make it their new home. They were happy but the others were not. They became jealous of the two friends. Leo a street dog, called Max a fool and said, “You are a stupid crazy dog.” Why else would you carry that lame crow on your back. What use would that useless bird be to you?” Chinni sparrow called Lucy a parasite and rebuked her for taking advantage of a poor deaf dog. The crows of the locality did not talk to Lucy since, instead of their company, she preferred to be friendly with Max. For their part, the street dogs avoided Max, since he had lowered himself by keeping company with a common crow.\nHearing all this, Max only laughed but Lucy became sad. “I am useless,” she thought. “I have always let Max do everything for me, but I have never done anything for him, nor helped him in any way”. As days passed, Lucy became more and more sad. “I must do something for Max, to show him that I love and appreciate his friendship a lot.”\nOne day, it was afternoon, Max was sleeping on one side of the road. Lucy, who was sitting near Max, suddenly spotted a large meat bone that had fallen on the ground, from the butcher’s shop on the opposite side of the road. Her eyes lighted up. “Let me get that piece of bone for Max. Thinking so, she limped across the road, dragging her left leg. Bending she picked up the piece of bone, with her beak and was crossing the road, when she saw a car coming at full speed, serving to the left and right. She also saw that Max had turned over in his sleep and was now, stretched halfway across the road. “I must warn him”. Lucy panicked and thought. Acting on an impulse Lucy threw the bone with all her strength, at Max. Startled, Max opened his eyes and saw the car. Acting instantly, he jumped across to safety.\nLucy had saved Max’s life, all the animals and birds now started respecting Lucy."

    "text": "Mini was a glossy hen. She lived in a house, near the woods, with her master, mistress and their young son, Raja.\nShe was liked by all.\nAs a very important member of the household, Mini was well cared for, petted and fussed over. As a result, she became very self- centered.\nOne day, Raja’s father brought into the house a Labrador called Duke. Lively and alert by nature, Duke soon found favour with his little master.\nHe was given the best dog biscuits to eat, bathed and cleaned regularly. He accompanied his master everywhere and even watched T.V with them in the drawing room.\nAs a result, Mini became jealous.  She hated Duke. Even though she was given the same treatment as before Mini felt she was being neglected.\nSo, she repulsed all the friendly overtures, made by him.\nNow there lived in the wood very near to the house, a cunning fox, called Jim.  For a long time his desire had been to make a feast of the fatty hen. He was however afraid to enter the house, as he knew that the master kept a gun with him.\n“He might shoot me”. Jim thought. However he awaited his chance.\nOne day, he found Mini standing with a sad expression on her face, near the gate. He knew that the cause was the dog, but still he acted innocent.\n“Hello”, he said, “I’m Jim and live in yonder forest.” He paused and added, “Can I help you in any way?”\nMini sighed.  “No one can help me anymore”she said.  Then suddenly getting angry she shouted, “That dog is the cause of all my misery. Oh, how I hate him!”\nJim nodded his head. ‘I know, I know, I have seen him walking about, like a king, with his master. He ignores you as if you were an unwanted commodity in the house.”\nHe paused to look around and then, cunningly said, “But why do you stay here?  Do you like being insulted and humiliated like this?\n“Don’t you want a free life, whereby you can do whatever you want to, and not be looked down on by anyone?”\n“Yes,yes”,Mini said excitedly. “But how do I have that life?”\n“Why, it is simple”. Jim said, his eyes glinting.\n“At night,when everyone is asleep, you have just got to jump over the gate and reach the wood.”\nMini thought for some time and then said “Okay”.\n“I shall be waiting for you, near the gate,”Jim grinned and muttered.\nNow when the conversation was taking place between the two, Duke saw them together, from inside the house.\nHe knew a conspiracy was being hatched. Somehow, he knew the fox was evil.  He decided to keep an eye on Mini.\nAt night, when everyone was asleep, Duke stayed awake. He heard Mini quietly move towards the garden.\nHe followed her, hiding behind the trees.  At the gate was Jim the fox.\nSlowly, Mini mounted the gate and dropped on the other side. Just then Duke heard a savage laugh\n“Now I have got you, you stupid hen. I will tear you to pieces and eat you, bone and flesh”.\nJim was about to attack Mini when something pounced on him. Growling loudly Duke bared his teeth at Jim.\nHearing noises, the members of the house switched on the lights and came running towards the gate. Seeing Duke and the fox struggling, with Mini standing nearby, they immediately realized what had happened.\nRaja’s father fired. The shot wounded the fox’s leg.  Jim let out a long howl, after which he half ran, half-limped into the woods and was never seen again.\nMini realizing that Duke had saved her life, felt ashamed, so she decided to apologize to him and change her behavior towards him. Very soon, the two became the best of friends."

    "title": "The hamsters and the weasel",
    "author": "Amber Brooke",
    "text": "Chapter 1\nOne bright, sunny morning, a hamster named Molly was staring out of her small glass container in the frost wood pet store. A few days ago, she and her best friend, Holly, had been taken from their mothers and separated from their brothers and sisters. Sure they missed them, but they were still happy to be together.\nChapter 2\nFor a few days at the pet store now, the weasels has been on sale and everyone wanted to buy them. This really bugged all of the other animals, especially Molly and Holly. “Hey, Holly.” Molly would whisper whenever she saw a weasel getting adopted, “doesn’t it bug you how everyone always wants the weasels and not any of us?” And Holly would say, “yeah. I really hope that one day they’ll pick us.” But they never did. It was ALWAYS the weasels. In fact, so many weasels were getting adopted that the store keepers were afraid that they would run out of them.\nChapter 3\n✓ Today, Molly was NOT up for complaining about the weasels. She had a plan. “Hey, Holly. Do you really want to get adopted?”. “Are you kidding? I’d give up food for two hamster weeks if it meant I got adopted.” Holly replied. “Okay. Well, good. Because lucky for us I have a plan to get out of here.” Molly reported. “Well, don’t just stand there. What is it?” Holly asked impatiently. “Okay. So, I was thinking we could pretend to be sick and lie down on our bellies and not eat or drink. Then, the second we get picked up, we leap into the weasel’s cage.” Said Molly courageously. “Great plan, but how are we gonna know if the weasel’s cage is open?” Asked Holly. “Oh, just wait until tomorrow.” Said Molly slyly.\n◦ Chapter 4\nThe very next morning, the two hamsters went over the plan one last time. “Okay” Said Holly when they had finally finished talking it all over. “But I STILL don’t see how we are supposed to get in that cage.” “I told you, you’ll see.” Said Molly impatiently. “Okay, here comes a worker with breakfast. Lie down and have no interest in the food, no matter what.” Molly announced. “Okay, got it.” Said Holly, lying down to look like she hadn’t eaten in a month. And Molly did the same. As soon as the plastic yellow bowl came into the container, the two friends closed their eyes. “Are you guys Okay?” Asked the worker. The hamsters responded with a roll onto their sides. Next, a giant hand reached in and grabbed them. And the second the hamsters were out of that container, they both took a flying leap towards the wide open weasel cage.\n◦ Chapter 5\n“We’re in!” Said Holly excitedly. “ you did it, Molly!” “Why, yes, she did.” Said a low, slick voice. “I am Willy weasel, but the call me Will. And you are?” “Oh, I’m Molly, and she’s Holly.” Said Molly, some reason in fear. “We are so sorry we-“ “no need for apologies. I don’t blame you for sneaking in and in my opinion I think it’s ridiculous that we are on sale and none of YOU are”. Said will. “Oh, um… thanks?” Said Holly. “No need to thank me, either. And let’s just get on with this, Okay?” “Get on with… what?” Asked Holly. Will chuckled. “There’s nothing to hide, girls. I know why your here. Why, you want to pretend to be weasels and get out of here.” “How did you know?” Asked Molly. “Now,now. Enough questions. I have a surprise for you.”\nChapter 6\n“What is it?” Asked both girls at the exact same time. “Well, I might just know away to get you girls out of here. But, you must be silent. Is that clear?” He asked. “Yup!” Said both hamsters immediately. “Okay. See that lady over there? Well, all I have to do is show off my little charm. Then, she’ll pick me. Now, YOU come in. YOU have to jump on my back and get adopted WITH me.” “Sounds good!” Said Molly.\nChapter 7\nThe lady was now right in front of the cage and Will was rolling around and making squeaking noises. She almost immediately picked him up. “Now!” He whispered. And the hamsters jumped on his back. But, his back was so slippery and silky, that they both fell off. “Will!” They cried.\nChapter 8\nWill glanced at them and sneered, “You should never trust a stranger, you tiny hair balls!” Holly and Molly were CRUSHED. They had worked so hard to get this and NOTHING. Soon enough, one of the pet store workers picked them up and brought them to the vet. The vet said they were fine, and some rest would probably help. And the two friends had learned something that day. Never trust a stranger, especially when they want to take you somewhere. Anyway, it wasn’t all bad. The girls eventually got adopted in a house with two eight year olds, a mom, a dad, and two guinea pigs.\nTHE END"

    "text": " \nAndrew lay shivering in his bed. The sky was alive with booming sounds and brilliant flashes just outside his window.\n \nFifteen minutes ago he asked, “Mom, will the storm last long?”\n \n“Please, don’t worry,“ she said. “The weatherman promised it would pass over Truro quickly. Now get some sleep.”\n \nExcept it didn’t; and he couldn’t.\n \nAndrew listened to his alarm clock. “Tick…Tick…Tock.” The night seemed to go on forever. Seconds turned into minutes.\n \nThen into what seemed like hours.\n \nAbove the house, loud lightning crashes made him duck further under the blankets. Outside thunder even rattled his window.\n \nShould he go into his parent’s room? But then he was a big boy now. And he had to be brave. Dad even helped him prepare for this bad weather.\n \nJust in case it lasted all night.\n \nNow his backpack was hidden under the blankets. It was filled with favorite toys, games and comic books. Even “Panda” bear he had since the age of two.\n \nMom made sure Andrew also had a few goodies. A huge bag of popcorn was close to his right side. And a bag of rippled chips was on the other.\n \nHis family had gone tenting in Cape Breton, last weekend. So he was now a boy with camping experience. And he knew how to be brave.\n \nWhat was moving around his toes? “Ouch, that hurt,” his trembling voice, whispered. The noise outside was so loud Andrew could hardly think.\n \nThrough the window, a dark sky blocked out the stars.\n \nThe boy was suddenly nervous. What was under the blanket? He was curious and rummaged through his backpack.\n \n“OMIGOSH,” Andrew said. “I forgot my flashlight.”\n \nHe slid out of bed and hurled himself across the floor. Andrew hunted around until he found it in the top dresser drawer.\n \nQuickly jumping back into bed, he forced cold feet down to the very end. Bare toes rested on something rough and sharp. Now it seemed to be crawling around his ankles.\n \nYikes! He wasn’t alone in bed!\n \nHe checked under the covers where it was black as coal, almost like being outside. Instead of gleaming stars lit up, spots looked more like eyes.\n \nRoaring came from behind his left leg.\n \nAndrew chewed on his left thumb and turned on the flashlight. “That terrifying sound couldn’t be…?” he hesitated.\n \nYes, a dinosaur! But that was impossible, wasn’t it? Dinosaurs couldn’t fit under bed covers belonging to a little boy, living inside his house. Right?\n \nWrong. Staring back at him was a Stegosaurus. And it tasted his Hostess vinegar chips, the one small bag with a few morsels left.\n \n“Get away, you!” Andrew bellowed, trying to be brave. The animal rumbled something back under the blanket-sky and hurried into a shadowy corner.\n \nNew noises caught the boy’s attention. His flashlight helped pick out moving shadows. What was going on? he wondered. There was a Triceratops and a Deinonychus.\n \nAnd a Tyranosaurus!\n \n“Run!” Andrew yelled. Suddenly he felt like he was the only one alive on the planet. But he was still under his blanket that seemed to expand in the distance and even high above him.\n \nHe searched for somewhere to hide.\n \nCold feet could barely move. It was like a different world under the blankets. His heart marched to the beat of a drum. Lightning zipped then zapped under his blanket-sky.\n \nLarge animals began to chase smaller ones.\n \nRacing toward him was a Dicraeosaurus. This was a peaceful plant eater and would not hurt him. But, Andrew couldn’t take any chances.\n \nHe pulled a fire engine from his backpack. Jumping into the front seat, Andrew turned the siren on full velocity. All it did was hurt his ears.\n \nA Ceratosaurus and Albertosaurus bounded after him. They were like large friendly dogs wanting to play. But Andrew didn’t wish to get crushed.\n \nHe stepped on the gas pedal. And the fire engine leaped forward.\n \nSoon, the road became a narrow path, aiming straight for the forest. Andrew quickly parked. Then he laced on new sneakers from his backpack.\n \nHe also brought his whistle. Shrill blowing warned everything to get out of his way. A flurry of feet escaped down the trail, each step pounding hard.\n \nOne arm held tightly to ‘Panda.’\n \nThe wind blew off his cap sending it into the distance. Branches snatched at his face. He didn’t want to get squashed or eaten by those dinosaurs.\n \nThe storm outside was nothing compared to wild animals chasing him under his blanket. How did all of this happen anyhow?\n \nGrowls and speeding feet kept pace behind him. Reaching into his backpack Andrew grabbed his roller blades. Now, he thought, it should be easy to skate away safely.\n \nThat is, until a sneaky tree root sent him headfirst into the mud.\n \nNow it was hurry-up time to climb a tree.\n \n“Mom, where are you?” Andrew shouted. “Daddd!” Skinny legs scrambled up the trunk. And like a monkey climbed higher from branch to branch.\n \nSuddenly between two limbs was the head of a Brontosaurus. It smiled as it chewed a mouthful of leaves. “What’s your problem?” it seemed to say.\n \n“Andrew! ANDREWWW!” someone called. Voices seemed to move back and forth and around like echoes. Yes, people were shouting his name!\n \nThe boy hastily threw off his blankets, sat up, and stared at mom and dad. He blinked as morning’s sun peeked between Venetian blinds.\n \n“Panda” was still tucked securely under his arm.\n \n“I see you found our surprises under your blankets,” mom said.\n \nAndrew looked blankly at his mom.\n \n“You know. Remember the dinosaur models you asked for last week?”\n \n“And I’m proud of you,” dad said. “Look how neatly you stacked them on your dresser.”\n \nAndrew felt weird as dad pointed.\n \nIn a neat row was a parade of colorful dinosaurs. They were following a friendly Dicraeosaurus, with a ferocious looking Tyrannosaurus Rex at the end of the line.\n \nLeading the whole group was a figure of a little boy.\n \nAnd he was holding tightly to a teddy bear.\n \nAuthor Notes:\nAll of the dinosaurs are correctly named in this Fantasy tale. My wife, Esther and I, also visited Drumheller, near Calgary Alberta where they once roamed.\n \n© 2012-17 Richard and Esther Provencher"

    "author": "Amber Brooke",
    "text": "Ginger and the six cats\nIt was a lovely day in the meadow and all of ginger’s six brothers and sisters were playing in the meadow’s freshly grown grass.\nAll of her brothers and sisters were grey, but ginger was a gold colour with orange stripes. Gingers brother’s and sister’s names were; Gray, Tom, Linx, Victoria, Petunia, and Polly. Ginger’s brothers and sisters teased her because she had ginger coloured fur and they all had grey coloured fur. This made ginger sad. Usually on days like this, ginger’s brothers and sisters wouldn’t let her play. So ginger would sit underneath a tree in the shade while she watched her brothers and sisters play in the beautiful warm meadow.\nA few days later the news spread that the cat races were going to began in 3 days. Ginger and her brothers and sisters sighed up. All of ginger’s brothers and sisters were surprised that ginger signed up for the cat races. “Why’d ginger sign up?” Victoria whispered to Polly. “Yeah,” agreed Tom. “Ginger’s such a big fraidy-cat. She’ll probably be so scared that she won’t be able to move. Then I’ll zoom right past her and be the first to the finish line” said Linx. “What are you TALKING about?!” whined Petunia. “Don’t you mean I’ll be first to the finish line?” “Don’t you mean I will?” As ginger’s brothers and sisters continued to argue, ginger prepared for the big race. She was timing herself as she did laps around the meadow.\nOn the big day, she was ready. Gray, Tom, Petunia, Linx ,Polly Victoria and ginger were all lined up at the starting line at the Claw-vill racing academy. The cougar referee was waiting patiently to drop the flag.\nWhile ginger and her brothers are sisters were waiting for the flag to drop, ginger pulled out the map to see where the racetrack went. Right now, they were at the entrance of the Claw-vill mall.\nThe race was from the beginning of the mall all the way to the end of the mall. The mall was very popular, so it was always very busy. Since the mall was so busy, it got expanded to a length of 1 MILE LONG.\nWhen ginger put away her map, there was only ONE MORE MINUTE until the flag dropped. So 1 minute later, the flag dropped. The race had BEGUN!\nLinx, the fastest of the litter, was in the lead. Ginger was following behind. Then the other boys caught up with Linx. “Hey, Linx!” panted Tom. “Since the other girls are so slow, how ’bout we stop at the salmon shack to get a bite to eat?” “Okay,” said Linx, not out of breath.\nMeanwhile, ginger and her sisters were still in the race. With Ginger still behind, Petunia was taking the lead. Polly and Victoria caught up with her. “Hey! Wanna stop at the ‘pretty kitty’ fur salon? It’s right up ahead.” “Okay, sure. Ginger should still be behind by the time we’re done.”\nSo now only ginger was in the race. She was expecting to arrive at the finish line and see Linx wearing a first place medal and all of her other brothers and sisters WAILING because they didn’t WIN. And When ginger FINALLY arrived at the finish line, her jaw dropped. None of her brothers or sisters were there! No. This couldn’t be right. Maybe they all went back to the den because she was taking to long.\nBut when the jaguar saw Ginger at the finish line, she said excitedly, “Congratulations! You just WON the Claw-vill cat race!” Ginger got handed a gift basket with a big golden can of sardines and a purple ball of yarn inside of it. Ginger couldn’t believe it. She had just WON the biggest race of the year!\nGinger went home with her presents and figured that her brothers and sisters would come back home once they realized what had happened. When her brothers and sisters got home, they were all sobbing because they didn’t win and because they were sorry. “We’re all so sorry, Ginger.” Said Petunia over her tears. Then they gave Ginger a big hug. After that Ginger forgave them and gave them each a sardine from her golden can. And after that, they all lived happily ever after.\nBy: Amber Brooks\nAge: 9"

    "text": "A painting competition was being organized at Sun Flower school in Green Forest, on Sunday. Timmy rabbit smiled smugly to himself. “I will surely win the contest and get the prize money of Rs.3000/”. He thought to himself.\nTimmy was a very lazy rabbit and he hated going to school.  Most of the days he pretended to have a headache or a stomach ache and stayed back home instead of going to school.\nHowever he was a wizard with the brush and no one could beat him in drawing or painting.\n“I will become a painter when I grow up, bookish knowledge is not that important for me,” Timmy would often brag to his friends.\nSunday dawned bright and clear, all the participants equipped with their pencils, erasers and colors came for the exhibition.\nTimmy decided to draw a scene showing Christmas in Australia.  First he drew a kangaroo and then several houses. Next using the white paint that he had Timmy covered the roofs of all houses in white to show it had snowed.  Dabs of white paint also showed that the roads were blocked with ice.  Timmy drew Father Christmas and wrote on top of a house ‘Merry Christmas’.  \n‘What a perfect picture’. Timmy thought to himself.  He thought of different ways in which to spend the prize money, ‘I will buy a cycle and several toys he thought'.\nIn the evening accompanied by his parents Timmy went to attend the prize giving ceremony.\nThe marks had been written on the picture itself.  Minus 50 had been scribbled on Timmy’s painting. Timmy stood nonplussed for sometime at a loss to understand the situation.\nSoon the chief guest started making the announcements.  The 1st prize went to Mona deer for her depiction of a desert scene.\nThe 2nd prize went to Tuna porcupine for a village scene which was very well drawn.\nTed the bear received the 3rd prize for painting a day at the fair neatly.\nThe chief guest next spoke about Timmy’s drawing. “It is a perfect picture but I had to minus marks because Christmas in Australia is never white, since it is summer during Christmas. How can there be snow?”\nThe principal nodded her head she spoke sadly after some time. “Timmy if you had attended your classes regularly, you would know that when it is winter in our part of the hemisphere it is summer in the Southern hemisphere. Fifty marks have to be deducted from your geography paper”.\nTears blinded Timmy’s eyes, what a fool he had been not to have known that one could never be a painter until one had a complete knowledge of his subjects.  Attendance in school was a must.\nTimmy decided to mend his ways after this. He regularly attended school and paid a lot of attention to his studies."

    "title": "Ug the Thug",
    "author": "Kenneth Steven",
    "text": "About five thousand, two hundred and forty-six years ago there lived a caveman called Ug the Thug. He lived at the top of a lonely valley, but then everywhere was lonely back then. He had a big club and furry boots and he liked running after things and frightening them best of all. Ug the Thug was nasty to everyone he met. It didn’t matter if the thing he met was big or small, he liked to give it a fright. He liked making as much noise as he could.\n‘Raaar!’, ‘Aaargh!’ and ‘Graah!’ were some of his favourite sounds. At night Ug the Thug came back to his cave. He sat beside his roaring fire and ate as much meat as he could. He painted pictures of himself on the cave and he felt very pleased indeed with himself.\nBut no-one liked Ug the Thug. Everyone was frightened of him and stayed away from him as much as possible. No-one ever went to his cave or even passed near it. They kept themselves to themselves. Then one night as Ug the Thug sat by the fire in the cave he saw a shooting star. A great white light streaked across the sky and he gasped. It was beautiful. Ug the Thug stared at the sky and for the first time in his life he wished he had a friend so he could tell them all about what he had seen. For the first time in his life Ug the Thug felt lonely.\nThe following day he went outside and he didn’t roar and thump about in his boots. Instead he went down to the stream that ran through the tall grass and sat there looking sadly at his reflection in the water. It so happened that at that very moment a mouse that had been crossing the river higher up fell into the water and began squeaking and waving its paws in the air because it couldn’t swim. Ug the Thug looked down and saw the mouse. Without thinking, he reached out his hand that was as big as a brick and he lifted the mouse very gently onto the riverbank.\nThe mouse shook itself and rushed off into the grass, and Ug the Thug just sat there by the river with his big head in his big hands. He felt lonelier than ever. That night he didn’t eat a thing, nor did he make a fire. He just curled up in bed and lay there not able to sleep. He felt very, very lonely.\nBut the next morning something happened. Ug the Thug had just got up when he heard the pitter-patter of tiny paws. Someone was coming. It was the mouse. And the mouse was carrying in its paws a flower. The mouse laid the flower down at the feet of Ug and looked up at him with its big blue eyes.\nUg the Thug fell over backwards. He landed in the sand outside his cave, completely amazed. He realised the flower was a thank-you from the mouse. He had made a friend! He felt so happy he began singing. He got up and danced about the cave for joy. He felt so good he waded across\nthe river, still singing. He couldn’t stop smiling to everyone he met. At first people were suspicious. Was it possible Ug the Thug could really be happy and friendly? Wasn’t he always angry and loud? But in the end they began to believe it must be true, and they smiled back and shook hands with Ug and laughed with happiness too.\nAnd after a time nobody was afraid of him anymore. He left his old, lonely cave behind and came to live with everyone else. He made lots of friends and never felt lonely again. And in the end he was given the name Ug the Hug because that was exactly what he liked doing best.\nThe End\n© 2015 Kenneth Steven"

    "title": "A Seaside Adventure (Ears Mouse)",
    "author": "Artie Edmonds",
    "text": "“Ears Mouse”\n“Book 3”\n“A Seaside Adventure”\n\n\nIt was a beautiful sunny day and Ears Mouse was eating a lovely thick slice of homemade toast, with his very favourite homemade Damson jam. He had made the Damson jam himself from fruits that had fallen the previous autumn and it had turned out very nice. He had the top section of his front door wide open and the Sun was shining straight into his kitchen. He could feel the warmth of the Sun on his face and thought to himself “this is going to be a very hot day” . He could hear a lot of activity outside his house as the many animals in Oak View forest went up and down the trail foraging for food.\nTap Tap Tap, he heard on the bottom of his door. He then heard some light scratching and then a black round thing popped over the top – Ears Mouse knew straight away that it was Harry Hedgehog’s nose as this was something he did a lot.\n“Morning Harry” Ears Mouse said.\n“Morning Ears Mouse” Harry said, “it’s such a beautiful day, isn’t it”?\n“Yes, indeed it is” said Ears Mouse.\n“I have just been to see our other friends in the forest and have asked them if they fancy a day at the beach” Harry said “it’s probably the last very nice day that we will have this Summer – so best to make the most of it” he continued. “are you up for it?” Harry asked Ears Mouse.\nEars mouse could think of lots of chores that he needed to do around the house, as he needed to fix a few things before the Autumn and Winter arrived, however he looked at Harry who had a big grin on his face thinking of the fun they would all have at the Seaside. Ears Mouse could not disappoint Harry and the others and inside he really wanted to go himself. “Now that sounds a fantastic idea” said Ears Mouse “ is everybody else up for it”?\nHarry did not need to answer that question, as just then all of his other friends appeared at his front door. There was Hammy Hamster, Molly Mole, Sid Squirrel and Freddy Frog. Olivia Owl was now perched on top of the door. They had all been listening in to Harry and Ears Mouse hoping that Ears Mouse would say yes – as it would not be the same without Ears Mouse. It always seemed to be a better adventure when he was there.\nAll of the other animals, except for Olivia, had sunglasses on and held buckets and spades, and each had a rucksack with drinks and food.\n“We thought that it would be best if we went to Shell Island beach” said Molly, “it is by far the nicest beach”. “isn’t that a bit too far to walk” said Ears Mouse, “especially on such a hot day like today and with all these buckets, spades and rucksacks to carry”?\n“Ohhh – I suppose you are right Ears Mouse” replied Molly, looking disappointed.\n“I have an idea” said Hammy Hamster, “we could ask Donald Donkey if he would like to come as well. I know where we can get some carrots for him to eat to give him energy for the journey”\nEverybody thought that would be a great idea. They all know that Donald could be a bit stubborn and moody sometimes, even though they were all good friends with him, and he always seems to be in a better mood if he could eat some carrots first.\nOnce Ears Mouse had packed his rucksack and put on his straw hat and sunglasses they all set off with Hammy Hamster leading the way to where the carrots were stored. The carrots were in an old wooden shed at the edge of a field and there was a small hole in the corner of the shed – just big enough for Hammy to crawl in. He handed out a few carrots to the others and Molly and Sid put them into their rucksack as they were larger than the other animals.\nSitting in the next field was Donald Donkey. They all approached Donald and told him what a great place Shell Island beach would be and that they would have lots of fun. “Are there any carrots there?” asked Donald Donkey. “OH YES” said Sid Squirrel quickly, before any of the others could reply ”there are some under the shells on the beach” . Sid knew he should not tell lies, but he also knew that if Donald knew that they had carrots in their rucksacks then he would ask for them now and then not feel like doing anything afterwards.\n“Yum Yum – carrots” said Donald, “OK – I’m in” said Donald. “Horray” the others shouted – jumping into the air – Freddy Frog managing the largest jump. Donald lay down in the grass, told everyone to climb onto his back and then he got up. When he got to the gate Sid Squirrel jumped onto it, opened it to let Donald out onto the track and then shut it. He then jumped onto Donald’s back again.\nOlivia Owl, hovering above, said that she would guide them all to the beach as it was a long time since they were last there. Whilst it was only about a mile or so it would have taken most of them all day to get there and another day to get back if Donald had not come along. With Donald doing all of the walking it was only a short while before they could see the lovely blue sea and the golden sand in view.\nWhen they arrived at the beach Donald walked around a bit until they had chosen a nice place near a sand dune. Donald sat down on his bottom and the animals all slid down his back like a slide in a fairground. “Wheeeeee” they all said as they slid down into the sand.\nMolly Mole and Harry Hedgehog started to lay out a picnic blanket while their other friends ran, hopped and flew down to the sea shore. Ears Mouse dipped his toes into the sea just as a wave went out – “Ouuuuuu” that’s a bit cold he said. Freddy Frog said that he did not like salty sea water as it made him itch. Donald walked slowly along the shore to cool himself down and then he sat in the water. Just then a large wave came in and he was not fast enough to get up and was knocked over. He quickly got up, the quickest anyone had ever seen Donald move in all of the time that they had known him . He then ran onto the dry sand. The other animals laughed for a while, but when Donald decided to dry himself off by shaking himself they all got covered in sea water and sand.\nEars Mouse almost got caught by a wave but luckily Olivia Owl swooped down in time and lifted him out of the water and onto the dry beach. “Thank you” said Ears Mouse to Olivia, “no problem” said Olivia.\n“Anybody hungry “ Molly Mole shouted. She had put all of the lovely food and drinks on the blanket. There was bread, cheeses, worms, insects, grain, milk and water. Ears Mouse had also brought some of his home-made cake and biscuits.\nDonald Donkey then remembered about the promise of carrots. “Sid”, said Donald, “where did you say the carrots would be”? When nobody was looking Sid had put some carrots in the sand and had placed large sea shells on top of them. “They live under sea shells” said Sid, “have a look to see if you can find them”.\nDonald lifted a few shells with his hoof and quickly found some carrots. He moved a few more with his nose and found some more. He was amazed that carrots grew under shells as he had never heard of that before. The others laughed at this so much it hurt.\nOnce they had all finished lunch they decided to play some games on the beach. Molly had brought an old tennis ball she had found buried in the ground when she had been digging under the ground. They threw this to each other until Harry Hedgehog missed it and it landed on the spines on his back and burst.\n“Let’s play a new game” said Freddy Frog, “let’s see who can jump the highest”. “Nooo” they all said, “you always win that one” said Harry.\n“I know” said Molly, “let’s see who can find the most interesting thing on the beach”. “Great idea” said Sid Squirrel and they all agreed.\nDonald though that carrots would be an interesting find and so he started to look under every shell that he could see on the beach. Ears Mouse found a nice shell which, when he held it to his ear, he could hear the sound of waves – or was it real waves he was hearing? Harry found a nice piece of seaweed with large round brown bubbles which popped if he sat on it. Molly found a lovely round and smooth stone, which she thought she would bring home to remind her of the beach. Olivia found a nice feather from a seagull which she would bring home for her nest.\nSid Squirrel had wandered down the beach a bit and then climbed a sand dune. As he came over the top he could not believe his eyes. There in front of him was a giant sea shell with a top and a bottom. He had never seen a shell so big before. It was so big that he thought that he might be able to fit into it.\nAfter a while all of the animals returned to the picnic area to see what each other had found, however there was no sign of Sid. They all decided that they better look for him and Donald Donkey lay down to let them climb on his back. Donald walked up and down the beach and then started to climb the sand dunes. “Stop” said Ears Mouse, “I can hear a noise like Sid shouting” – Ears Mouse had very good hearing due to his large ears. “Over in that direction” he said, pointing in the direction of one of the sand dunes.\nDonald climbed the sand dune with the others hanging on to his fur so that they did not fall off. When he got to the top of the dune they all saw the very big sea shell. “Wow” said Harry, “I’ve never seen a shell that size” and the others agreed. They could see that the shell had a top and a bottom but it was closed.\n“Are you in there?” said Ears Mouse, knocking on the shell. “Yes” said Sid, “I closed the lid to see if I could fit inside and now cannot get the lid open again – please help to get me out”\nOne by one the animals tried to prise open the lid of the shell but it was jammed shut. “I can’t see how we will get this lid open” said Ears Mouse, “it’s jammed shut”. Just then he had an idea and whispered something in Donald’s ear. Donald got up very quickly and hit the big shell with his hoof. The shell lid flew open and Sid jumped out just in case it closed again. “What did you whisper into Donald’s ear?” asked Molly. “I told Donald that a giant shell may have a giant carrot under it” laughed Ears Mouse.\nSid took a carrot out of his rucksack and gave it to Donald to thank him for freeing him from the giant shell.\nIt was getting late by this time and everyone agreed that they had better set home before it got dark. They packed up their blanket and picnic leftovers and put them into their rucksacks. Donald lay down and let them all climb onto his back and they started on their way home.\nHowever, they did not get far before Donald came to a halt. “Whats up Donald?” asked Sid. “Nothing” said Donald, this is just what donkeys do sometimes. “So what can we do to make you move again?” asked Sid. “Have you got a carrot?” Donald asked. When Sid told him that he had one remaining in his rucksack Donald told him to tie it on the end of a stick and to dangle it in front of Donald’s nose. Sid broke off a branch of a hazel bush and tied the carrot onto the end of the branch with a pink ribbon which Molly leant him. Just like magic Donald started to walk again following the carrot in front of him.\nIt was not long before they arrived back at Donald’s field, which Sid opened and closed as he had done before. “Thanks Donald” they all shouted as they waved goodbye to him. Sid gave Donald the last carrot which he enjoyed.\n“Everyone coming back to my place for some nice toast and jam?” asked Ears Mouse. “Yes please” they all said. They had really enjoyed their seaside adventure today.\nThat night Donald had a lovely dream about a giant carrot hiding under a giant shell by the seashore and fell asleep with a big smile on his face.\nTHE END\n\n“©2013 Artie Edmonds”"

    "title": "PUGSLEY",
    "author": "Richard & Esther Provencher",
    "text": " \nJoe liked hikes. And this one was going to be really cool. Ted, his best pal was here. Other friends included Martin, Greg and Josh. Mr. Maxwell was the group church leader. And his assistant Larry was also Joe’s big Brother.\nThey all crawled into the Safari Wagon. Each kid tumbled around until they found a soft spot. The ride would take a half hour. Destination: an underground cave.\n“It’s closed up now but a great trail goes right by it,” Mr. Maxwell explained. He also asked everyone not to stand too close to the old entrance. “Rock slides happen all the time,” he said.\nJoe was allowed to bring his dog, Pugsley. He was brown with a pug-nose. Joe had gotten him for his seventh birthday. In the last two years they became really good pals.\nHis mother helped him pack this morning. Joe was so excited he couldn’t find his packsack. Or his spare socks, or his thermos.\nGood ole mom. “Bring my boy back safely,” she had prayed over him.\nPrayers were okay. But he could take care of himself. Besides, Pugsley was coming along.\nAs they drove from Truro they passed the low tide area of Cobequid Bay. Then traveled along a twisting road through the settlements of Old Barns and Prince Port. Before long the asphalt road turned into a pitted gravel road. Mud and water flew in all directions.\nSuddenly the driving was over. “We’re here!” everyone shouted.\nA scramble of feet, packsacks pressed to shoulders, car doors locked and the hike was begun. Mr. Maxwell led the way, followed by anxious and noisy boys. Larry took up the last spot.\n“I expect everyone to follow single file on the trail,” Mr. Maxwell said. He was not only the Pastor, but everyone respected him. So they listened.\nPugsley’s excitement took him in little circles. The exercise was good for him. Joe remembered the little dog the first time he saw him. He had watched when the dogcatcher tricked the little dog by offering him a juicy bone.\nWhen the net came down, Joe thought it was a mean trick. After mom and dad heard their son’s sad tale they just had to see this dog. And maybe bring him home. Joe promised to take good care of the frisky pooch. That was the bargain. And so Pugsley found a new home.\nNow Pugsley tore across the trail and into the trees. He went up one ravine, then down another. Joe didn’t have to call him back, since Pugsley always returned to his master.\nWhen they came to the river Pastor Maxwell put on his chest waders. Then tied a pope to a tree by the water’s edge. After crossing over he tied the strong yellow rope to another tree. Low and then higher up. And he returned to the same side he had left.\nWhen it was finished everyone saw it was like a walkway. One line was on the bottom for feet and the other shoulder high to hold onto.\nThis allowed each boy to cross the stream without getting wet; and everyone crossed safely.\n“I did it!” Joe yelled. He acted brave even though he was afraid of heights. And didn’t even fall in the water.\n“If you do, you’ll only get wet,” Larry had said. But no one did.\nThe hike continued after everyone crossed the river. There was more snow on this side. And crunching sounds filled the air. But the spring thaw and burst of sunshine meant it would not last. Joe was happy to be in the woods, as young legs stretched with each step.\nMr. Maxwell called everyone forward, as they approached a cliff rising above the trees. “This hill is quite high,” he said. “And our trail goes close to the edge.”\nBoth Pastor Maxwell and Larry helped everyone over the icy parts. Pugsley was fortunate to have hard toenails help with his balance. Joe suddenly began to slide towards the pond at the bottom of the hill. “Oh My Gosh,” he said.\n“Hold on Joe,” Larry called, and scrambled after him. Joe’s dignity and muddy bottom were quickly returned to the trail.\nAs they all got closer to the cliff they heard rustling noises. Pastor Maxwell said, “Like I said, stay close to the bottom of the cliff.” Just then a large rock fell near one of the boys. Josh jumped then pressed against the side of the cliff.\n“As long as we stay close to the cliff,” Pastor Maxwell said, “everyone will be alright.”\nJoe held Pugsley’s collar and looked around. A perfect toboggan hill lay to his right. Fallen rock had broken into fine pieces and created a long descending slope of light colored mud.\nFinally, they reached their destination. Halen’s Cave looked like a black smudge at the edge of the trail. Joe remembered looking down into a well once. The darkness had scared him.\n“There’s about a four-foot drop into the entrance,” Pastor Maxwell said. “We can try climbing down this summer. Now, let’s take a break on the other side by the trees.”\nCuriosity tugged at Joe. Pugsley was restless too. Joe was last in line and had to get going to catch up to the group.\nAs he turned his hand dropped Pugsley’s collar. The little dog scampered a few feet then slipped. Yelping several times he lost his balance and tumbled down into the black empty space of cave.\nJoe was shocked. “My dog.” he called out. “Mr. Maxwell!” he finally yelled. Dropping on his belly he looked down, barely able to see at first. Then his eyes got used to the darkness.\nPugsley looked like he was in a large cavern.\nJoe reached down, trying to grab Pugsley’s jumping paws. Just as he slid into the hole he heard Pastor Maxwell calling his name. Now boy and dog lay on the floor of the cavern. It was beautiful in here. Rivulets of water spilled from a crevice on one side of the wall.\nIt looked like moss around the floor and in one area, solid ice was smooth as glass. Joe looked around, but no Pugsley. He could hear barking far away. The cavern stretched a long distance.\nHe had to get his dog. Joe prayed for strength. Nothing bad could happen to him if he had faith. He remembered those special words from his Sunday School teaching. “Suffer the little children to come unto me,” the Bible said.\nWorking up his courage, Joe moved forward, watching his step. He had to be careful not to twist an ankle on the ice. His breath produced mist in the cool air. He felt much better after praying for his little dog to return. Joe stopped, knowing enough not to go any further.\nThere could be more tunnels or even holes to fall into.\nWhen Pugsley returned to his side, Joe’s voice sounded eerie when it said, “Thank you Jesus.” The two of them then carefully worked their way back to the tunnel entrance.\nPastor Maxwell was frantic, asking loudly, “Are you okay? Are you?”\nJoe felt badly. He didn’t want his Pastor to be afraid. Joe wasn’t. First he helped boost Pugsley out. Then it was his turn. Strong arms lifted him.\nEveryone gave him a hug. He could see how nervous everyone was. Pastor said the hole was too small for himself or Larry.\nLarry gave Joe a big wink. “I’m proud of you,” he said. “You were very brave.” The rest of the trip was icing on the cake. Having a prayer of thanks for Joe’s safe return, eating lunch and a snowball fight.\nBy the time they returned to the rope crossing, Joe was too tired to hang on. So Larry carried him on his back through the shallow water. Joe felt like a conquering hero. He had overcome his fear of the dark to get his dog.\nFrom here he could see everyone waiting on the other shore, even Pugsley who swam alongside. His wet little dog was also brave. Joe had a great day, with good friends. He gave Larry an extra hard squeeze around his neck.\nWait ’til mom hears about this trip, he thought. Joe’s face broke into a smile. His lips said, “Thank you Jesus…for everything.”\n* * *\n© Richard & Esther Provencher 2007"

    "title": "Tri-Boy",
    "author": "Paul Moore",
    "text": "Once upon a time down in the bog there lived a little frog who was different from all the others. This little frog had three hind legs, and his name was Tri-Boy. All the other little frogs had two hind legs. Tri-Boy was kidded unmercifully because he was different. The other little frogs at times talked down to Tri-Boy. They would not let him play any of the games that little frogs usually play.\nOne day all of the little frogs were going on a picnic, and their mamas had packed them a lunch of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and lemonade. This time they reluctantly included Tri-Boy in the picnic. He was so happy, and he ran and told his mama and daddy that he was going on the picnic and to hurry and pack his lunch. The picnic was to be held near Farmer Brown’s animal farm. All of the little frogs wanted to hike over to the farm, have lunch, and look at all of Farmer Brown’s animals–the mules, the pigs, the chickens, the cows, and the goats.\nThe little frogs didn’t know it, but Farmer Brown had dug a deep pit along the path that leads from the bog to his farm. The pit was there to catch foxes and other predators who wanted to get his chickens, and the pit was covered over with sticks and leaves so that it would not be seen. As the little frogs happily danced and jumped down the path, singing songs, and hooting and hollering, they suddenly all fell in the pit and were trapped. They were very upset and were afraid that Farmer Brown would come along and find them in the pit and be very mad at them. He had very little patience with any animals outside his farm. And his wife had a wonderful recipe for Southern fried frog legs.\nAll of the boy frogs tried to jump high and out of the pit so that they could go and get help. They all fell back in the pit, though, unable to reach the top. Finally, Tri-Boy said, “I think I can do it,” and the other frogs laughed–they didn’t think that Tri-Boy could do anything that they couldn’t do. But little were they thinking that Tri-Boy had three hind legs while they only had two.\nHis third leg gave him the ability to jump with a super force. Tri-Boy exhaled, took five deep frog breaths, and jumped as high as he could and jumped up and out of the pit! All of the frogs in the pit were surprised that Tri-Boy could accomplish this amazing feat and began to cheer. Then they asked each other, “What will Tri-Boy do now?” But Tri-Boy was already running to find a long stick, which he brought back and dropped down in the pit. He hollered down and told all of the frogs to climb up the stick and out of the pit. The little frogs, one by one, crawled up the stick, and when they all reached the top, they gave three cheers for Tri-Boy. “Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!”\nThe little girl frogs were especially thankful to him for saving them from Farmer Brown. Then they all carefully hopped on down the path. They stopped and had their picnic lunch. Tri-Boy was offered any extra treats that the others had. They finally reached the animal farm and enjoyed watching and naming all of the animals. From that time on, Tri-Boy was looked up to by the others and always included in the little frogs’ activities.\nTHE END\n©2000 Paul K. Moore"

    "title": "Merlin the Monkey",
    "author": "Mikey Green",
    "text": "Merlin the Monkey\nOne day, a group of four friends decided to pay a visit to the local carnival, which had stopped in the village for the weekend. It only came once a year, and the group of friends were ever so keen to explore the wonder of the carnival. The sounds and the sights were so exciting, and amongst beautiful fields, it made for a special event. Rose, Samantha, Vanessa and Michael were as happy as anyone that this weekend had finally arrived. They brought their pet monkey along with them to share in the fun. His name was Merlin, and with the gentlest smile and dazzling eyes, plenty of the villagers had affection for Merlin. The people who ran the carnival came from different countries, and spoke different languages. Merlin had never attended a carnival before, and his owners were keen to show him a good time.\nUpon arrival at the carnival, the group of four friends got in close to talk about where they should head first. They quickly made up their minds to head for the haunted house, and turned around to take Merlin with them. To their surprise, Merlin was not there. He had disappeared amongst the crowds, causing panic and worry amongst the four friends.\n“Fear not!” shouted Rose, “We shall use our skills amongst these carnival folk to find our beloved Merlin”. Each of the four friends had a skill that was helpful in finding lost people or animals; they had done it before to find Samantha’s younger sister, Rachel. Rose could do a drawing of who was missing so that she could ask people if they had seen anyone looking like Merlin. Samantha spoke many languages and could ask any people from another country if they had seen Merlin. Vanessa was able to do the sounds and actions of Merlin to see if anyone recognized them, and Michael could beg and plea in song as to whether anyone had seen his beloved Merlin.\nThey tried to find Merlin at the Haunted House, where a man was looking after the ride. Rose drew a picture of Merlin and asked:\n“Have you seen my Merlin?”\nThe man grunted, and it seemed he did not know English. Samantha quickly asked the man in another language if he knew where Merlin was. The man answered in such a way that all four of the friends knew that Merlin was not at the Haunted House.\nNext, they went to the teacups, where Vanessa did the sounds and actions that Merlin normally does. The woman looking after the teacups laughed and turned away. Michael began to sing and used his song to ask a question, and the woman took notice of this, and replied “I’m sorry my dear, I have not seen your monkey”.\nFinally, they went to the carousel, hoping that Merlin would be there somewhere. Rose showed her drawing of Merlin to people, but nobody knew where Merlin was. Michael sang, but nobody answered back. Samantha asked questions in many languages, but no good news came. Finally, Vanessa did the sounds that Merlin makes, and similar sounds came from the carousel. Merlin ran towards the four friends, who embraced Merlin for what felt like an eternity. The four friends and Merlin held hands for the rest of the day, so they would not lose each other ever again. They went on all the rides until the sun went down, and left the carnival that night, looking forward to its return next year.\n©2008 Mikey Green"

    "title": "THE GUMMY DOG SHOW",
    "author": "Richard & Esther Provencher",
    "text": "“ARRROOOUF! “ Ace, a proud black dog, sat on his favorite corner of Main Street and Robin Road. His thick-as-a-rope tail THUMP-THUMPED on the sidewalk. Cars, trucks and bicycles crossed in front of him in a blur of rolling wheels.\nClose by, an unseen sticky glob of gum waited for something to happen. \nAce’s tail pounded cheerfully as stores opened. It was fun watching men and women and boys and girls going up and down the sidewalk. Sometimes they came over and scratched his head. THUMP, THUMP went his tail.\nThat tail smacked up and down, up and down, and oh…oh, right on top of that sticky, gooey glob of bubble gum. \nAce stopped. Something was wrong. There was no more up and down; no more THUMP-THUMP. Yes, something was really wrong. There was no sound from his smacking tail. He tried to lift it, but it was stuck. \nAce stood up and gave a mighty pull. He pulled with his strong, sturdy legs. Finally, he began to move, S-L-O-W-L-Y. \nA string of pink rubber pulled his thick-as-a-rope tail backwards. \nAce was not happy, and he smacked his tail down hard. This was no joking matter for a proud pooch. \nHe had places to go, things to do. There were trees to sniff and four legged friends to visit. He was a busy dog, and this was not funny!\nAce leaned forward using every ounce of his strong doggy power. Slowly, his tail began to stretch and S-T-R-E-T-C-H. \nA crowd began gathering around him and pointing at the funny sight. \n“Come see a dog and a gooey-gum show!” they shouted.\nIt was not funny to Ace. He had to put an end to this foolishness.\nHe had to prove who was boss of the corner of Main Street and Robin Road.\nHowever, the glob of gum had other ideas. It had been left behind before, but not this time. It wasn’t letting go of this new friend. \nAce tugged and pulled, and his tail stretched and S-T-R-E-T-C-H-E-D. By now it was at least one storefront long. It was a battle between gum and dog. \nThe crowd shouted and clapped and laughed, as Ace’s tail grew longer and LONGER. \nSparrows flew under his tail, and children jumped over it, in a game of Follow-the -Leader. \nHot air steamed from Ace’s nose and ears. He squeezed his eyes tight. The harder he pulled, the more tightly the glob of gum held. Every time he pulled with his FULL power, fur flew in all directions.\nPeople ducked from showers of loose dog hair. Some used umbrellas as they watched this amazing Tug-of-War. \nA man from the Daily News snapped a few pictures and wrote lots of words on a pad of paper. \nSomeone set up a popcorn stand. “Get your snacks at the “Gummy Dog Show!” they shouted. “25 cents a bag!” \nTwo girls sold lemonade in front of Morgan’s store. Thirsty customers stood in a long line for a glass of the cold drink on that hot, hot day. \nSandy’s Toy Store had a kite and hula-hoop sidewalk-sale. The street looked like a holiday parade. \nAce was running out of fur, and his tongue scraped on the sidewalk. \n“POP !” The contest came to an end like an exploding firecracker. People heard the sound way over on Pickle Street, like a cork out of a bottle.\nYes, it was true. The glob of gum finally let go. Was it because the gooey-glob was no longer sticky? Perhaps it was tired. After all, Ace was a very large dog with four powerful legs. \nAce flew across the sidewalk, tail over toes. He was a rolling ball of flying fur, followed by his LONG stretched-out tail.\nAround and around he rolled, all the way to the end of the block, where he finally crashed into a trash can with a sign that read: KEEP OUR STREETS CLEAN.\nAce shook his head. The sky and the sidewalk spun around and around. \nWhen the street stood still, Ace stood up. THUMP-THUMP-THUMPITY-THUMP-THUMP went his long, long tail. He liked it! \nHe proudly looked up at corner sign… Main Street and Bacon Road. \nHe sniffed the air with a happy sigh, his tug of war finally over. He gave his tail a wiggly THUMP- THUMP- THUMPITY- THUMP- THUMP on the sidewalk. \nAce and his long, long, long tail was now boss of one whole block of Main Street from one corner to the other.\n© Richard & Esther Provencher 2016"

It was afternoon Diana was dozing, when little Gigi slipped out from under the duck’s wings into the sunshine and started chasing ants.\nJohnny the fox who had been waiting for this golden opportunity for many days and specially that day, since he knew that Gigi’s mother was away caught the chick in his iron grip.  However before Johnny could feast on Gigi he heard his name being called from far.  It was his friend Sam fox coming to meet him.  “I don’t want to share you with anyone “, Johnny said to himself.  He put Gigi in a wooden box lying in front of his den and banged the lid shut.\nWoody the woodpecker had watched the proceedings sitting on a tree and heard the chicken’s cry of agony. ‘The poor dear will die of suffocation in the wooden box’, Woody thought.  As soon as Johnny had left  to meet his friend Sam, Woody flew down from the tree, sat on the box and made holes on it with his beak.  Air started flowing into the box and Gigi was able to breathe again.\nIn the meantime Diana duck in search of Gigi heard about the entire incident from Roma the butterfly and before long Dona deer, Ruby Giraffe, Tuna porcupine had all heard about Gigi’s plight.  It was Charlie monkey prancing from tree to tree who was able to reach the wooden box first and pull open the lid.\nJulie hen on her return was united with Gigi she was most grateful to Woody the Woodpecker, without whose prompt action her baby would have died.  The two became the best of friends from henceforth.\nJohnny fearing the wrath of the animals decided to leave the forest for good."

    "title": "THE MISSING PICNIC FOOD",
    "author": "Paula Moore",
    "text": "Once upon a time there was a forest fire in a big, big forest. All the little animals that lived there ran as fast as they could to get away from the hot flames. Squirrels, raccoons, foxes, snakes, turtles, rabbits, mice and many other animals had to find new homes. Some of them went to other forests, some of them went to parks, and some of them actually had to make their little homes in the yards of human beings, or, people.\nFar, far away from the fire was a house where three little children lived. Their names were Thomas, Kathy, and Carrie. They all went to school but on this September day it was Saturday. They had been playing all morning. Now it was lunchtime. They were hungry. They asked their mom if they could have lunch, and she said, “Why don’t you have a picnic in the yard”?\nThat sounded like a great idea, but WHERE in the yard? So Mom told them to lay a picnic cloth in the green grassy grass near the scruffy old juniper bushes. While they were doing that, she would make some celery sticks, carrot sticks, and some yummy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\nWhen the kids had spread out the picnic blanket, they ran into the kitchen and asked if lunch was ready. Mom told them to take the carrot sticks and plates out to the blanket, and to take their drinks also. So Thomas, Kathy and Carrie took these things out to the blanket and arranged them carefully. Then they ran as fast as they could, huffing and puffing, back to the kitchen and said to Mom, “What else have you made so far”? So she said, “I’ve got your celery sticks cut up for you now – run these out to your picnic blanket.” So out ran the three kids as fast as they could go to add these to the carrots on their plates.\nBut when they got to the blanket, something was wrong. Where were the carrot sticks? They were all gone! “This must be a trick,” said Kathy. “Let’s leave the celery sticks here and see what happens!”\nThen they ran as fast as they could back to Mom, who by now was making the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. They told her that someone had stolen the carrot sticks. She said, “You’re kidding!” and they said “Come on – we’ll show you!”\nMom hurried out with them to the picnic blanket. But now, not only were the carrot sticks missing, but the celery sticks were gone, too! Mom said, “Maybe one of your neighbor friends is hiding them just to be silly.”\nSo everyone spread out and looked behind trees, bushes, and just about everywhere. Unfortunately, they couldn’t find the carrots, the celery, or anyone hiding.\nFinally Mom said, “Well, your drinks are still out here. Let’s get your sandwiches. You guys go ahead and eat them out here and maybe something will turn up.”\nSo Thomas, Kathy and Carrie sat down to their picnic and they ate their sandwiches. Of course, while they sat there, they couldn’t help but look around for the sneaky celery and carrot thief.\nThey were just about finished eating when Carrie looked over at the juniper bushes and saw something move. She softly said, “Shshsh!” to Thomas and Kathy. “There’s something wiggling over there! See the bushes moving?” So everyone sat very still, and a little brown animal came to edge of the bushes and looked at them. It was a rabbit. Quietly it went back into the bushes.\n“I have an idea”, said Thomas. “Let’s get more celery and carrots, and see if that rabbit is our thief. We’ll put them at the edge of the bushes, and watch from the window.”\nThey quietly went back into the house and got Mom to cut up more celery and carrots. They carefully put them down near the bushes and walked back to the house. As they watched, the little rabbit came out and grabbed the vegetables in his mouth and carried them back into the juniper bushes. Mom had watched, too, and she said that she had never seen a rabbit in the yard before. She thought that maybe because of the forest fire, he had needed to look for a new home.\n“Maybe we can keep feeding this rabbit, and he will stay here for a long time,” said Mom.\nThat is just what they did. They fed the little rabbit every day. A few weeks went by. The weather turned cooler and finally winter came and they didn’t see the rabbit. Sometimes they would take food out to the edge of the bushes, and sometimes the food would disappear, and other times it just stayed there. All winter they worried about the rabbit – was he cold, was he scared, did he move somewhere else?\nFinally, spring came. They watched for the rabbit day after day. In early April, the day before Easter, when the trees had just a few leaves, Thomas, Kathy, and Carrie took the food out to the bushes, and as they watched, the little rabbit came out and grabbed it! Whatever he had done during the winter, he was OK now!\nThe kids continued to feed him, and one day, the little rabbit came out to get his food, and he had four little rabbits with him! Their rabbit was a Mommy rabbit!\nSo from that time on, the kids fed the rabbits, and year after year, there was always a little rabbit family that lived in their scruffy old juniper bushes.\nPaula Moore"

They each loved Bella very, very much. \nPlaytime at the park, and nice long walks were a regular for Bella. She even had a sister dog (who was actually a pitbull named Cammie).\nThey played together day and night.  \nBella and Cammie both became a part of this family in their own special ways.  Both dogs, although opppsite breeds, were each loving and sweet and playful.  \nOne day, while the children were at school and Mommy had went to work, Nelson decided to rearrange the furniture in the house.  \nAs Nelson rearranged the furniture, he suddenly became hot.  Nelson opened up the front door for some fresh air. \nBoth dogs ran to the front yard to play. \nNelson continued to rearrange the furniture to surprise Mommy when she got home from work.\nInstead of being surprised that the furniture was just as she asked it to be, she was sadly shocked to hear that somehow Bella had ran out of the yard and was now missing.  🙁\nHow would Mommy tell Emily, AJ, and Adelisse that their puppy was now gone?\nWhat is Mommy going to do?\nWill she ever be able to find little Bella?\nWhile Nelson walked around the neighborhood, Mommy asked the neighbors nearby if they had seen little Bella…\nOne of the neighbors stated that earlier there was a Terrier Mix that may have been Little Bella, wandering outside of the property.  The neighbor delivered the sad news that a woman in a black jeep noticed little Bella wandering alone and out of fear she would be hit by a passing car, she picked Bella up and took Bella with her.\nMommy was so sad that she started crying. \nMommy pulled herself together and called the Animal Shelter.\nThe Animal Shelter had not heard anything about anyone finding  Little Bella and they suggested Mommy call Animal Control Services.  \nMommy then called Animal Control Services, who works in conjunction (together) with the Sheriffs Department in their town.  \nThe Animal Control Services hadnt heard anything about Bella being found by anyone yet either. But they suggested Mommy send them a photo of Little Bella just in case anyone who found her turns her in.\nThey also suggested that Mommy post Bella's picture on a 'Missing Pets' page on facebook.\nMommy did exactly what they suggested. \nIt was now time for Mommy to pick up Emily, AJ, and Adelisse.\nUpon sight, the children immediately asked for little Bella when they only saw Cammie, their pit bull. \nMommy didnt know how she qould break the news. She calmly explained to them what had happened. Mommy told them to have faith and to pray for Bella's return. The children cried. As they were heartbroken their puppy was gone.  They prayed just as Mommy suggested. Mommy prayed too. In fact, Mommy prayed three times with tears in her eyes.\nGod answered their prayers.\nLuckily, there are still good citizens in the world. And someone responded to the public post that Mommy put online.\nSomeone posted that their co-worker found Little Bella and that they would give the lady Mommys phone number.\nMommy waited for the lady to call.\nJust before bedtime, the lady finally called.  Mommy was anxious to get Little Bella back and asked if she can pick her up right away.\nThey decided on a meeting place not far from where Bella was found.\nAnd the sweet lady returned Little Bella to her family.\nEveryone, (even Cammie, their other dog) was filled with such joy that Little Bella was now home.\nMorals of the story:\n 1)Always have faith and trust in God\n2) Never leave your dog unattended.

    "text": "It was Bunny rabbit’s birthday but since she was new to the Evergreen forest she had no one to celebrate her birthday with as she did not have any friends. Bunny had migrated from Black forest to the Evergreen forest after she had lost her parents and siblings in a landslide. Her life had been saved since she had been out visiting her friend at the other end of the forest.\nIt was almost noon and Bunny was walking alone in the forest when her alert ears picked up a sound of an impending danger she could have leaped away to safety herself but she thumped the ground as a warning to others.  Dina the zebra dozing under a tree heard the sound got up and fled to safety.\nIt was only after sometime that Dina realized that a rabbit had actually warned and saved her from the jaws of Rusk the lion that she sought Bunny out and befriended her.“Can I take you for a ride in my car?”  Dina asked. “I bought one recently.”\nBunny was thrilled she had never ridden in a car before. It was in the car that Bunny and Dina shared jokes and thoughts and grew closer to one another Dina wished Bunny after coming to know that it was the latter’s birthday that day.\nThe car passed through desert land hills and plantations. Bunny noticed a crate in the car.  “ There is a cave at the end of the road that we are taking, my friend Simi the bear lives there if we can collect some mushrooms in the crate Simi will whip up a grand meal for us “.\nThe car soon entered the forest again and it was while driving through the forest that the friends saw a mother rabbit with a basket and two children in tow moving through the forest. It was mother rabbit Julie and her children.\n“Hello Julie where are you going?” Dina stopped the car.“To the apple orchard for apples, there will be no food for my children until the apples are handed over to Aunt Matilda.” Julie said.\nDina nodded ever since Julie’s husband went missing she was staying with her uncle Jeff who loved her and his wife Matilda who was terribly strict as far as duties were concerned.  Apart from the household chores Julie helped her aunt  with the jam making business too.‘’ Hop in “, Dina said.  Though there was not much space in the car Julie squeezed in between Dina and Bunny, the two little bunnies sat on the bonnet of the car holding on to the windscreen wipers. Dina drove very slowly.\nVery soon the car reached that part of the forest where there were a number of apple trees.  Julie and her bunnies got busy plucking the apples.  Watching them Bunny was reminded of the days when she along with her siblings and parents had travelled for days in search of herbs to make medicine as her father was a doctor.“How are you going to return home with the heavy apple basket?” Bunny asked.“Uncle Jeff will be passing by soon in his truck.  He is a florist and sells flowers in the market.” Julie said. “He will take us home.”Dina and Bunny decided to move on. Julie thanked them. \nDina and Bunny did find mushrooms but saw Ami and Bimbo sitting on them and having tea.  The rats did offer the two friends tea but would not part with the mushrooms which they had grown themselves.  It was only after Dina informed them that it was Bunny’s birthday and they could join them for dinner at Simi the bear’s cave that Ami and Bimbo helped Dina collect mushrooms in the crate. A surprise visitor was Uncle Jeff at Simi’s cave Julie had sent a bottle of jam for Bunny Dina had informed her it was Bunny’s birthday. At the cave Bunny saw Simi limping having hurt her leg due to a fall.\nShe decided to put the knowledge of herbs she had gathered from her father to test made a paste of the right herbs and put the mixture on Simi’s leg.\nSlowly the pain started to ebb.  “She will be fine soon,” Bunny said.\tFeeling much better Simi made a great meal of mushrooms and peas, while Bunny was busy mixing herbs Dina went and bought a cake from Jumbo elephant’s bakery nearby. Bunny cut her cake she was overwhelmed as she remembered her family but one had to accept life as it came.Soon it was time to leave Bunny thanked everyone what a wonderful day it had been she had made new friends celebrated her birthday and above all she was never going to be alone again.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                        SHARMILA ROY GHOSAL"

Squirrels were her most favourite prey though she liked rabbits and rats too.  Animals were scared to come out of their homes even for food. They racked their brains in search of an idea to get rid of the eagle menace permanently.\nIt was Bunny rabbit from the village at the end of the forest she had come for help, a vixen had been troubling the village people by stealing their hens and ducks and escaping suggested a plan that could eliminate both the vixen and the eagle.  Bunny had come at night to the forest but since then had not been able to return to the village for fear of Dina.\n“There is a spot between the forest and the village and one has to lead the eagle till that point I have seen the end of many eagles there”.Bunny said.\nThe idea was very risky the eagle could swoop down anytime and take the animal leading her.\nTimmy the squirrel decided to volunteer. The other animals tried to dissuade him but Timmy was adamant.\n‘’ I will hide in the holes of trees and the eagle will not be able to get me.” Timmy said.\nWoody the woodpecker made holes on trees big enough for Timmy to get in.\nOne fine morning Timmy came out of his home and scampered up the nearest tree and got into the hole.  Hearing the rustling of leaves Dina saw Timmy but could not get him. From one tree to another Timmy led Dina.   Frustrated and livid with rage Dina followed Timmy but could do nothing the eagle could not enter the hole and get the squirrel.  They were nearing the end of the forest,when suddenly Timmy spotted the vixen near a rock  he made a barking sound in order to disturb the animal and attract the eagle’s attention before taking shelter on the last tree. The vixen startled out of her sleep made a howl like noise.\n Dina saw the vixen swooped down and dug her talons on her shoulders a struggle ensued and the vixen in order to escape fell into a gorge at the side of the forest.One enemy was wiped out the little squirrel thought.\nThis was the moment Timmy was waiting for he identified the spot Bunny had told him by the side of the pole made as much noise with the leaves as he could. Dina who was soaring high trying to regain his strength after the exertion of a tussle with the vixen heard the rustle of leaves saw Timmy and in rage swooped down Timmy closed his eyes his end was near he was sure, suddenly there was a thud the eagle lay dead on the ground electrocuted by the overhead line.Timmy was standing near an electric pole. “I have seen the end of many eagles there”. Bunny rabbit had rightly said.\nTimmy heaved a sigh of relief and everyone praised the little animal’s heroic deed which had saved the lives of so many animals.\n                                                                                                                                                                                SHARMILA ROY GHOSAL"

Mary deer was at her wit’s end, her income depended on the sale of bananas and some vegetables that she grew in her kitchen garden.\nTed had become a regular nuisance every afternoon he would alight on the wall of the house devour some bananas and swing away.

Mary did not even know Dodo then and he was touched by her kind gesture.\nDodo stared in anger at Ted suddenly he started running backwards the quills got detached from his body and flew towards Ted stabbing him on all sides.  Before long Ted was rolling on the ground and crying in agony“Stop Dodo stop” Ted pleaded.\n“I will if you promise never to visit this house again “Dodo said.Ted promised before limping away. Mary who heard Ted’s screams came out of the house and thanked him profusely.\nDodo was happy that he could repay Aunt Mary’s kindness in his own way.\n                                                                                                                                                                                 SHARMILA ROY GHOSAL"

Albert was a kind hearted elephant he put down the basket of bananas he was carrying for his aunt and started to lift the rock that blocked the mouth of the cave.\nCharlie monkey sitting on a tree saw the bananas in the basket and while Albert was busy Charlie lifted the bunch of bananas and scampered off.\nJenny who had returned with food for her baby was overcome with gratitude when she realized what Albert had done. The rock which had come loose after the landslide had rolled in front of the cave and blocked it only after Jenny had left. Jenny thanked Albert profusely. The elephant was about to leave when he noticed that the basket was empty and the bunch of bananas he was to take for his aunt missing. Albert searched here and there but could not find the bananas. It was then that Judy squirrel informed him that Charlie the monkey had stolen his bananas. Albert was miserable but did not know what to do.\nEven though Jenny gave Albert some raspberries that she had collected in the forest to take for his aunt the two friends were filled with anguish. Each day some animal or the other would suffer because of Charlie. He would destroy gardens, eat mangoes, bananas and anything he could lay his hands on. Albert was too kind hearted to take revenge however Jenny thought of teaching Charlie a lesson.\nShe decided to take help of Tootsie the leech and her friends. Bob the rabbit was also roped in to play a part. He readily agreed to help since the monkey had uprooted all the saplings in his garden just for fun.\n“Cover us nicely with flowers”, Tootsie said. It was evening Bob carried a basket full of white flowers on top were two bananas. He stopped under the tree Charlie sat on. Seeing the bananas Charlie scampered down the tree. Bob sat under the tree, “I am so hungry and tired.” he said. He started peeling a banana and bit into it. Charlie looked wistfully at the other banana, “They are damn sweet,why don’t you try one?” Before Charlie could grab it Bob had it in his hand “There are plenty inside “, Bob pointed to the basket “Why have you covered the basket with flowers?” Charlie asked perplexed.\n“Can’t take the risk of them getting robbed they are for special friends like you.” Bob encouraged Charlie to take a banana.\nHungrily Charlie dug his fingers inside the basket and with a yelping pain tried to extricate his hand while a dozen leeches bit into his flesh. Charlie cried for mercy and it was only after the other animals who had been waiting behind trees decided to forgive Charlie after he promised never to harass anyone again that the leeches decided to let go of him.\nSHARMILA ROY GHOSAL"

    "text": "Once upon a smelly time, there was a skunk that HATED smells!!!!! His name was Kevin. Kevin was often sad; he was made fun of all the time by the high school humans. The other reason why he was sad is because he had no one to care for him: no friends, no family, nothing.\nCourageously, Kevin tip-toed into the bathroom to get some blue mints (or as you and I know: toilet thingy-magigs). Annoyingly, there were his arch enemies lurking by the bowls of lemonade AKA toilets with wee in them!!!!!!\n“Hey! What are you doing here, Stink Bomb?!” Sniggered Ben and his gang, who were laughing behind him. Sneakily, Kevin tried to scurry off without Ben or his gang noticing him (unfortunately he left a stinky blue scent behind).\nStupidly, silly old Kevin accidentally walked into the girls’ bathroom thinking it was the disabled cubicle to get some peace and quiet. Red like roses, Kevin’s chubby cheeks blushed when he realized he was in the wrong place; the girls were screeching in disgust at the horrible sight. As quick as they could, the girls fled like they had seen a ghost. Luckily, there was a twinkling in the room where Kevin’s fairy skunk mother fluttered down with her angel-like wings.\n“I shall grant you three wishes\nYou can make the world shine\nBe careful of your choices\nBecause not everything will be fine.”\nKevin’s jaw dropped in delight; he instantly knew what he was going to wish for – the one thing he had been wishing for his whole life!\n“I wish for: no smell, no smell, oh and…..no smell!”\nWithout hesitation, Kevin strolled down the street like he was the coolest guy in town. However, no one paying attention; this never happened, but the thing was… he liked all the attention! Even though the attention was negative, at least people were noticing him! Kevin was very confused; he always thought that without his smell his life would be perfect. He realized having all the attention already made his life perfect, strangely! After being up all night, trying to think of a way to reverse the wishes, a light bulb popped out of his head – he remembered that the wish only lasts for 24 hours (he only knew this because The Fairy-Skunk-Mother had left a note on some toilet roll!!!!!!!) In order for the wishes to cease, he had to do a funky dance in front of the high school humans!!!! He didn’t care; he strutted into the middle of the high school humans where he wiggled and jiggled\nand boogied all night (well actually it was only for 5 minutes).\nAs quick as a lightning bolt, a flash came from the sky and then he saw all fingers pointing at him.\n“Stink Bomb…Stink Bomb…You’re a Stinky Stink Bomb!”\n“Oh be quiet”, he shouted at them courageously, “If you say that one more time, I will let some stink bomb off on you!!” The vile humans then scurried off like rats. Kevin then lived smellily ever after!! ☺\nIsabella Hopkins"

    "title": "Henna and Her Wiggly Tooth",
    "author": "Ranjeeta",
    "text": "Henna, the baby hippo wasn’t very happy. In fact, it had been two days since she had smiled at all! It all began a couple of days back when she was brushing her teeth as usual in the morning and she felt a strange feeling in her mouth. She continued brushing. Brush, brush, brush…There, she felt it again. She looked in the pond at her reflection and touched the spot where she had felt it. And goodness! Oh, goodness! Her teeth was wiggling. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle… it went.\nShe ran to her mom and in a trembling voice said, “Mama, my tooth is falling out. I brush it every day and still, why?” Mama smiled at her and said, “Oh, my little one has become a big girl now! It is only your milk tooth, Henna. Milk teeth will fall out one by one and new strong ones will come in their place, my dear”. Henna was horrified. What? Her teeth will fall out one by one!? What a sight she will look then. She didn’t want to lose her white pearly teeth. Oh, no!! And that is why she stopped smiling, lest her teeth fall out.\nMommy Hippo kept asking her again and again to wiggle it lose or the new one would come out crooked. But she refused to listen. Mommy hippo was only worried she might accidentally swallow it, but Henna didn’t let her come anywhere close. Tired of all the fuss Henna was making, she told Henna sternly that she would give her one more day to take the tooth out herself and after that she would have to take her to Dr Gerry Giraffe to pull it out.\nHenna went to bed a very scared hippo. She had a very restless night, twisting and turning. Suddenly, in the middle of the night she sat up straight. She thought she  heard a strange sound coming from her mouth. Boo… hoo… hoo…!!! It went. Hippo ran to look in the tiny piece of mirror she kept in her little treasure hole in the corner of the cave. She had quite a few collection of things there. One lost shoe, a piece of chalk and a key were just among some of the things she found near the river bank on days she managed to slip away unnoticed from her mother. Now she opened her mouth wide and what do you think she saw there?!! Her wiggly tooth was crying! Yes, it had eyes and a mouth and as soon as it saw Henna looking at it, it started wailing even louder. BOOO…..HOOO….HOOO….!!! Henna was so shocked she nearly forgot to breathe for a few seconds.\nThen she gathered her wits and gently asked, “Can you tell me why you are crying?” The tooth stopped crying and said, “Didn’t you know, that if you don’t pull out your teeth in time and put it under your pillow for the Tooth Fairy to find it, it will be lost forever?” “Lost forever?” asked the confused Henna. “Yes,” said the Tooth. “When the Tooth Fairy finds the milk tooth, she takes it to a faraway land called Milky Land. All the milk teeth collected from children around the world are brought here where we have the Milky River. All the teeth jump into it, splash around and have fun till they are spotless and white again! A few days later they are taken back to the children and planted in the same spot in the mouth as a new tooth.”\nWow! I didn’t know that”, said Henna, feeling very excited now. “So what is the problem then?” she asked. “Well, you see when the child doesn’t pull out a tooth in time, the Tooth Fairy plants another tooth beside it. The new tooth grows and pushes the milk tooth giving the mouth a rather crooked smile and very soon the child is taken to a doctor to get the milk tooth removed. And when that happens the tooth is lost forever and it can never go to Milky Land!” said the tooth and began crying all over again louder and louder!! “Alright, alright, I understand”, said Happy. “But are you sure?”. “Of course I am sure. If you don’t believe me see for yourself. There is the new tooth right beside me.” Said the tooth indignantly. Henna looked inside her mouth closely and sure enough there was a new tooth right next to it. It was just a white little spot.\n“Hmm…. Alright then. I will pull you out. But you better come out fast because I am scared.” The tooth nodded happily. Henna closed her eyes and nervously tugged at it. And out it came! It was so easy and it hardly hurt her at all. She felt very proud of herself for doing it all by herself. “But what will happen to you?” she asked. “Are you lost forever now?” “No, no I can stay in Milky Land forever thanks to you,” said the Milk Tooth as Henna placed her gently under the pillow. And Henna went to sleep yawning, for she was very tired after this little night adventure.\nWasn’t it brave of Henna to help out the tooth even though she was scared? I am sure the Tooth Fairy will be leaving a nice amount of money for her under the pillow for being such a brave little girl. Did you pull out your first tooth on your own too?\nRanjeeta\n© www.sleepyowls.net"

    "title": "St. Uny Fairy School",
    "author": "Imogen Morris",
    "text": "Once upon a time there was a school for fairies called St Uny High and the fairies in that school were always extremely good. In the school there was a very special group of friends, their names were Silvermist who wore a beautiful blue dress and at 14 years old the eldest of them all. Then there was Idressa who was 12 and wore a sunburst yellow dress. Next was Tinkerbell who was 11 and wore an emerald green dress. Then came Rosetta at 10 years old and wore a ruby red dress. Vidia was next at 9 years old who loved wearing her pretty purple dress then finally there was Fawn who at 8 years of age was the youngest of all the friends and wore a ginger orange dress.\nOne weekend they were playing in the woods and an idea popped into Fawns head. “Hey Guys! Shall\nwe go to Unicorn Meadow?” The friends were not so sure and a little scared but reluctantly agreed. So they all flew off to the meadow, but when they reached there the Unicorns had mysteriously disappeared, however fortunately Silvermist with her special powers could sense where they had gone. She said “Guys, they have gone over the hill to the Cold Side of the meadow.”\nNow the Cold Side was an area at the furthest point of Unicorn Meadow and it was strictly forbidden for any fairies to go near it by their Head teacher, Miss Lopez. But they simply had to find the Unicorns.\nSo they plucked up the courage and flew on up and over the hill. Not that far on they saw one of the Unicorns, Vidia used her magic fairy dust to round him up and sent him back over to the safe side. Then Tinkerbell saw another Unicorn and rounded that one up with her magic wand and sent him on his way back. Next Idressa rounded a Unicorn up, then Silvermist, then Fawn, then Rosetta but there was one more still missing.\nOn they flew closer and closer to the Cold Side, until they came across another friend who was Tinkerbelle’s 15 year old sister, Periwinkle, who wore a snowy white dress and was standing next to the last missing Unicorn. “Hi Sis” said Tinkerbelle, “Why are you here?”\n“I had a strange dream last night” said Periwinkle, “I dreamt that the Unicorns were in trouble so here I am, let’s get this one rounded up and back to the safe side of the meadow.”\nSo Periwinkle waved her wand above her head to cast her magic over the Unicorn but…… something strange happened.\nThe clouds darkened, the wind whistled as the leaves blew off of the trees. The thunder roared as a bolt of lightning struck the ground not twenty feet from them. Suddenly there in front of them stood their Head teacher, Miss Lopez, in the form of a hideous old troll. Her skin was a grotesque green colour with ugly hairy warts on her face. Her hair was filthy and knotty and her clothes were no more than hanging, dirty rags.\n“Girls!” Exclaimed Miss Lopez, “I am furious with you all for disobeying my rules and coming over to the Cold Side of the meadow!”\nSilver Mist explained “We didn’t mean to come over to the Cold Side of the meadow, but we had to get the Unicorns back to their field.”\nFawn then asked “What has happened to you Miss Lopez?”\nMiss Lopez replied “This is who I am. This is where I live. I told you not to come here, but you did! And now this is where you will have to stay forever as you cannot ever return home. My secret\ncannot ever get out….ever!”\nSuddenly a long, crooked, magic stick appeared in Miss Lopez’s hand, she lifted it high above her head to cast her evil spell on the fairies, when Tinkerbelle suddenly shouted “Stop!!! You don’t have to do this Miss Lopez.”\n“You can come back with us and still be our Head teacher” Idressa added.\n“You don’t have to live out here, Miss.” Vidia stressed.\n“You can still be a troll and a Head teacher.” Rossetta said, “But just be a kind troll and a nice Head teacher”.\nMiss Lopez’s face once again screwed up in anger as she raised her magic staff again to cast her evil spell and all the fairies shouted “We love you, please come back with us!”\n“After all” Said Tinkerbelle, “We are all different but we can still be kind and thoughtful to each other.”\nMiss Lopez’s scowling face slowly relaxed as she gradually lowered her staff. Tears began to roll down her cheeks and a huge beaming smile appeared on her face.\n“Thank you my beautiful fairies” Said Miss Lopez in a now softer voice.\nWith that silver light shone from behind the fairies Head teacher and wrapped around her like a stunning twinkling cloak. A moment later the silver light faded and now a beautiful young Miss Lopez stood in front of them. The fairies stood with their mouths open.\nMiss Lopez explained, “You have just broken a 400 year old spell which was put on me by an evil old Witch. The spell was to turn me into a Troll after the home time bell rang at the end of the school day and would return me to normal just before the start of school the following morning. I lived over here on the Cold Side of the meadow so not to scare any of you, my lovely fairies. The spell would only be broken if any of my fairies would show me kindness and love when I was in my Troll form, and you did, I am so grateful to you my lovelies.”\nAnd with that Miss Lopez gathered up the last remaining Unicorn and turned towards her beautiful Fairies and said “Shall we go home ladies?” They all smiled and nodded as they turned to make their way back to St Uny High, where they all lived happily fairy ever after!\nTHE END\nImogen Morris"

    "title": "The Snow Mouse (Ears Mouse)",
    "author": "Artie Edmonds",
    "text": "Ears Mouse,   Book 2  \nEars Mouse woke up with a shiver, ‘Brrrrrrrrrr’ he said to himself, ‘I am in my nice bed with my big quilt but I am still cold, specially my nose’.  His nose was almost as red as Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer’s nose.  He had his night cap on his head to keep his ears warm and had also put some extra blankets on top of his quilt, as he had thought that it might be cold that night.  He looked at his clock on his bedside table, it said 8:45 – yet he could not see any light shining through his curtains as it normally did at that time of morning.\nEars Mouse counted 1- 2 – 3 and then jumped out of bed, ran over to his door, grabbed his dressing gown and put it on as quick as he could.  He then went over to his window and opened the curtains.  All he could see through his window was white stuff, like very thick fog.  He decided that he better light his fire to make his house feel a bit warmer.  Using some old newspaper and some twigs, Ears Mouse tried to get a fire going but each time a good flame went up the chimney a big drop of water would come down the chimney and put the fire out.  Ears Mouse thought that he would have to go outside to investigate.  So he go dressed very quickly and put on his warmest coat, his wellies, gloves and scarf.  He opened his front door and walked out into the fog – or at least he tried to.  Ears Mouse bounced back into his house and landed on his bottom on the floor.  It then struck him – it was not fog, it was snow.  He now realised what had happened, ‘it must have snowed very heavily last night and has blocked my chimney, door and windows’ he thought to himself.\nEars Mouse was very worried now, ‘how am I going to get out?’ he wondered, ‘I do not have much food left in my larder as I was planning to gather some more food today’.  He though that he had better start to dig himself out just in case the snow did not melt for a few days, so he got his shovel from the cupboard in the kitchen and stuck it in the snow in his doorway.  ‘Hang on’, he thought, ‘where am I going to put the snow that I dig out’.  He realised that he would have to put it into his house.  After  a while Ears Mouse had snow all around him and felt like he was standing in a freezer.  He was starting to feel very cold indeed.\nOutside things looked a little bit better.  Harry Hedgehog had been looking for some nice juicy grubs that morning and had raised the alarm when he saw what had happened to Ears Mouse’s house.  During the night the snow had blown along the lane and the strong wind had made a snow drift all over Ears Mouse’s house.  Many of Ears Mouse’s friends were now discussing what they could do to help get him out of his snow covered house.  There was too much snow for the animals to shift using just spades and shovels.  ‘We could ask Donald Donkey to stamp on the snow to make it smaller’, said Harry Hedgehog.  ‘No, that would be too dangerous’ said Sid Squirrel, ‘Ears Mouse may be digging his way out and he could get stamped on’.  ‘I have an idea’, said Molly Mole, ‘I could try and make a hole through the snow’.  ‘Molly, have you ever burrowed through snow before?’ asked Freddie Frog.  ‘No’, replied Molly, ‘but is should be much the same as burrowing through the earth , just a bit colder.  ‘I think it’s a great idea’, said Sid Squirrel, ‘does everyone agree?’.  Everyone agreed it was the best plan so far.\nMolly prepared herself for her journey through the snow.  Sid Squirrel loaned her his bobble hat which she wore on her nose to help keep it warm.  Harry Hedgehog loaned her his sweater, even though it was full of holes from his spiky spines.\nMolly started to dig through the cold snow and luckily it was not too hard.  Meanwhile, back in Ears Mouse’s house, it was now very cold and Ears Mouse was starting to look a bit blue.  He had not managed to get very far through the snow before his shovel’s handle had broken.  He was now using his hands to dig his way through the snow but it was so cold he could not feel his fingers.  Standing back from the snow, to have a rest, Ears Mouse though he was starting to see things.  He could see a red blob in the snow and it was getting bigger and bigger.  It was the red bobble hat on Molly Mole’s nose that was poking through the snow and soon after Ears Mouse could see Molly’s head.  ‘Molly, am I glad to see you?’, said Ears Mouse, ‘I was just about to freeze if I had to stay in here any longer’.  He gave Molly a hug and then followed Molly back through the hole.\nThere was a loud round of applause when Molly Mole and Ears Mouse both climbed out of the snow tunnel.  All Ears Mouse’s friends gather round and gave him a big hug.  Sid Squirrel put a big warm blanket around Ears Mouse’s shoulders and Harry Hedgehog gave him a hot water bottle, being careful not to make a hole in it from his spikes.  They all went back to Harry Hedgehog’ place as he had lit a big fire.\nEars Mouse sat beside the fire drinking a lovely mug of vegetable soup and was soon feeling much much warmer. \nHarry Hedgehog’s house was so warm that the other animals decided to go outside and build a snowman – well actually a snow mouse like their friend Ears Mouse.\nTHE END\n©2007 Artie Edmonds"

    "title": "The Butterfly and the Fire Breathing Dragon",
    "author": "Deborah Rossi",
    "text": "A long, yes very long time ago there was a dragon, a most evil, wicked and feared fire breathing Dragon called Dre. Or so it was believed that he was most evil and wicked – but later, and as the story will tell, it will be learned that Dre had been shunned by most which is why he turned bitter, evil and wicked.  Until one special day, one very special day he’d meet and cross paths with a butterfly, a butterfly named Faith.\nFaith lived in Butterflyville with siblings Hope, and Harmony.  Faith lived a most joyous and happy life, fluttering through life with Hope and Harmony until most recently when she’d awaken to learn that her siblings had simply vanished.  Thinking perhaps they were just playing an old fashioned game of butterfly hide and seek Faith flew from one corner of the tree to the other, looking from one lily to the other until she could stand it no longer and called out, “come on you two, come out, come out wherever you are!”   Surely now they would fly out and laugh at her for not being able to find them but neither Hope nor Harmony appeared. As minutes turned to hours daylight to dark and there was still no sign of Hope and Harmony Faith cried herself to sleep , alone and confused not knowing what tomorrow would hold in store.  Exhausted and with no other choice but to sleep Faith drifted off hopeful that with the start of a brand new day perhaps she would awaken to find both Hope and Harmony.\n\nAnd with the next day’s burning rays of sun Faith stretched her wings, yawning to meet the brand new day.  Quickly remembering she had a mission today and that mission was to search for Hope and Harmony and search she would!  Faith flew from tree to tree, lily to lily once again making sure Hope and Harmony weren’t carrying out some silly little game and in despair after not finding either Faith entered  into the deep dark forest.   Although worry she did as she heard tales about Dre the fire breathing dragon, Faith knew there was, just simply no other choice.   So deep and deeper into the forest Faith flew.  Along the way Faith ran into Rattle, hissing and snarling he spoke to her and said ssss faith,  I ssss seen Hope and I ssss saw Harmony – they were behind the rock wall just a few ssss short ssss steps away, Faith hurriedly flew to the rock wall.  Hope, Harmony she cried, it’s me it’s Faith!  And just as she had landed on the lily by the rock wall Rattle tried to catch her, ssss swallow her.  And just as suddenly as Rattle tried to swallow Faith there was a shrill cry “watch out”….and Faith flew to the nearest and highest tree limb.  “Whew”, cried Faith thanks for saving my life.  Why who are you?  Bunny is my name said the brown long eared rabbit.   Dear Faith, what brings you, alone, into the depths of the forest?   Sobbing Faith explained she couldn’t find her siblings and would search anywhere and everywhere she could until she found them. And then just as Bunny was getting ready to tell her about Dre there was a ROARso loud and so scary they both huddled together and scattered into the nearest cove they could find.  And when they found the courage to peek out what seemed like hours later, they saw Dre, the fire breathing dragon, with big dark eyes, and green scaley body and why, the longest tail Faith had ever seen, but fire?   Faith saw no fire.\n\n\nFunny, although both Bunny and Faith were trembling with great fear, Faith thought hmm, Dre didn’t look evil and wicked and, well, he wasn’t breathing fire. Perhaps the tale of Dre and the fire was just that, a tale, after all.  But Bunny begged Faith not to leave the cove where it was safe – and in that moment Faith stood tall and explained she was on a mission and had to find Hope and Harmony.  Faith appeared at the opening of the cove and startled Dre who wasn’t expecting anyone to be in the forest.  Suddenly fire emerged from Dre’s mouth and Faith had to fly hurriedly to avoid being burned, and in her haste she hadn’t realized she didn’t fly quite far enough away from Dre.  Faith fell to the ground a wing singed unable to fly any further any longer.  Bunny watched in horror but, frozen with fear, couldn’t find the courage to come out of hiding and help her.  Surely Dre would not them being in his forest, surely Dre would…..and then Bunny, when he couldn’t imagine any longer saw something that he never in a million years would have ever imagined he’d see….it was Dre and, did he see a small tear in the fire breathing dragon’s eyes, he wondered? And as he watched he saw that Dre was headed to a small stream where he’d placed some water in his mouth, carried it back and let it flow gently over Faith’s singed wing.  Shaken from the cold water and the fear of waking up to seeing Dre directly above her Faith tried to fly away again falling to the ground.\nAnd it was then that Dre spoke, I didn’t mean to harm you I am not evil and wicked I am alone and confused. And Faith came to realize that Dre was very much like herself.  Faith tried to perch herself along the rock wall resting to try and get her strength back and she explained to Dre that it was the loss of her siblings Hope and Harmony that brought her into the deep woods where normally she wouldn’t enter, she knew this was his territory but simply, she just had to find them no matter what the risk.  And Dre putting his dragon hand out for her to fly into explained that it was also unlike him to venture out of the deep woods where he’d been outcast to for many, many years.  And as Faith and Dre shared their tears and their laughter Dre explained to Faith that all he really wanted was to be liked and to have friends.  And just as Faith and Dre discovered they shared many things Bunny appeared, Rattle appeared, and creatures unknown to them all appeared. And in the distance fluttering and flying back to Faith were Hope and Harmony, and it was at that very moment there was a peace and serenity in the deep woods unlike any had ever known or seen before.  Among an understanding of creatures great and small – there was Faith, there was Hope and there was Harmony.\n \n \n\n \n                                                                                             The End\n©2012 Deborah Rossi"

    "title": "Mitty’s Surprise",
    "author": "Shelly Morris",
    "text": "Mitty the Kitty opened her lazy green eyes and yawned.  The sun was rising and it was going to be a beautiful day. She stood on her tip toes and stretched. Her black fur shimmered in the sunlight. She licked her white paws.  She was proud of her special colors.  It appeared that she was wearing mittens. Her children had named her Mittens but called her “Mitty” for short. Her white whiskers wiggled as she enjoyed the smells of morning.\n Suddenly Bob and Betty Bumble Bee buzzed by. “Wake up Mitty!” said Bob.\n“The flowers are blooming, the flowers are blooming,”  announced Betty. They both buzzed loudly around Mitty’s ears.  Mitty made friends with everyone. Some of her friends were very different from her but this only made them more interesting to Mitty.\n“I see them,” she answered.  “Aren’t they  lovely?”  Mitty loved the smell of flowers. They tickled her whiskers. Spring was her favorite time of year.  The whole backyard was full of life renewing itself. She began walking around the house. Bob and Betty followed her, buzzing all the way. “Are the children out?” she asked.\n“No, but I saw them through the window eating breakfast,  breakfast,” answered Betty.\nMitty found her favorite, shady spot near the door and lay down.  “I think I’ll just wait here for my breakfast,” cooed Mitty.\n“Well, we have work to do,” said Bob.\n“Busy, busy, busy.  See you later Mitty,” Betty shouted as they buzzed away.  Mitty closed her eyes and began to purr.  She loved her friends and family.  And she had the best backyard in the whole world. Yes, she was a lucky Kitty.\nJust then, the door flew open.  A rambunctious six year old boy came thundering out.  He patted Mitty on the head, then filled Mitty’s bowl all the way to the top with food, spilling some on the floor.  She meowed her thanks.  Looking up at him she noticed that he was getting bigger and bigger every day.\nSuddenly the smaller boy stumbled out.  He was two years old.  Mitty knew he loved her.  He even meowed like her, although she was never just sure of what he was saying.  He bent over and rubbed her ears as she ate.  He even picked up the pieces of spilled food and put them into her bowl. He meowed and then bounced away. They were such special children.\nAs Mitty finished her breakfast, she heard,  “Tweet,  tweet.  It’s just not fair,” Rita the Robin squeaked.  Mitty smiled up at her as she flew overhead.  Rita the Robin was one of Mitty’s dearest friends.  She lived in the old oak tree in Mitty’s backyard.  Most kitties and birds did not get along. But Mitty was a special kitty and she enjoyed her unusual friends. Mitty licked her paws.  “I have to hunt for my breakfast,” Rita continued.  Mitty knew there were plenty of fat juicy worms around the house.\n“I will help you hunt for worms,” Mitty began.  “It will be an adventure.” So Mitty dashed around the grass and bushes.  Rita tip toed around following Mitty. They were a funny sight. Then Mitty spotted a small puddle of water. “Over there,” she shouted as she ran towards the water.  Rita scooped down and snatched up a wiggly worm into her beak.  Then she ate two more.  “Do you feel better now?”\n“Oh, yes!  You sure do have an eye for worms,” she  thanked her friend. They both lay near the cool water and relaxed enjoying the quiet peacefulness of the day.\nSuddenly a loud SSSHHHHH sound echoed through the sky.  Mitty jumped to her feet. “What was that?” she shouted.  Then the sound came again, SSSHHHHH.\n“The clouds are falling,” Rita proclaimed.  SSSHHHHH it sounded again. “Help, help!”  Rita flew around in circles not knowing where to hide.  The SSSHHHHH sound grew louder.  Rita flew down to Mitty and snuggled close to her friend.  Mitty could feel the small robin trembling with fear. Mitty hugged her tightly, feeling her own heart racing.  Just then Bob and Betty Bumble Bee buzzed over to them.  SSSHHHHH rang through the clouds again.\n“What is it? Bob questioned.\n“I don’t know,” Mitty answered.  She felt as though  she may cry. The sound was so odd and unfamiliar. And it was growing louder, SSSHHHHH.\n“Oh my, oh my, maybe it’s a bad storm,” Betty  observed.  All four friends gazed around the sky.  Winds were blowing calmly and the sky was clear and blue.\n“It doesn’t look like stormy weather,” Mitty pointed  out.  Rita still pressed against her. SSSHHHHH the sound echoed again.  Then the sound of children shouting began.  Bob and Betty took cover underneath a nearby bush.  “Oh dear, what can it be?”  Mitty and her friends exclaimed.  Mitty put her paws over her eyes hoping the strange sound would drift away as quickly as it had come.\nSSSHHHHH the sound was almost on top of them now.  “Look  Mitty, look!” shouted Rita.\n“For goodness sakes,” Bob buzzed.\n “Great gigantic balls of fire, balls of fire!” Betty proclaimed.\nMitty peaked out from behind her paws.  SSSHHHHH the noise was here, in her own backyard.  She squinted her eyes and to her astonishment, saw a huge hot air balloon drifting over her house.  It was spectacular. Laughing children came running after it.  It had red, yellow, and blue stripes with a basket underneath. Two people were riding in it, waving and throwing candy to the children below. SSSHHHHH the funny sound was loud again, but not frightening anymore. It was almost a funny sound. Mitty looked at Rita. “It’s wonderful, isn’t it?”\n“Oh yes,” Rita said.  “It’s quite breathtaking.” They continued to hug each other. Bob and Betty stared at the enormous balloon, then gave each other a quick buzz kiss.\n“Thank heavens,” Bob said with relief showing in his  voice.  “Got to go. Work to do, flowers to visit.”  Then they buzzed off happily.\nMitty and Rita enjoyed the spectacle.  The balloon hovered  over their backyard.  All the children from the neighborhood were there.  Mitty saw her older boy picking up candy as fast as he could.  The smaller boy shouted, “Balloon, Balloon,” and he pointed to  the enormous sight.  Slowly it made it’s way over the trees and out of sight with a faint SSSHHHHH. The children disappeared into the house.  And all was back to normal in the happy backyard.\nMitty and Rita relaxed and walked back over to the small puddle of  water for a drink. “What a day,” Mitty said.  “I must admit I was a little scared.” She was very thirsty and lapped up the water swiftly.\n“Yes, I was too,” said Rita.  “It was an incredible sight. The children really loved it.  I hope I get to see another one some day. But the next time I won’t be scared. I learned a new sound today.”\n“Me too.” Mitty cleaned her paws and the two friends  found a quiet spot underneath the old oak tree.  “We have food, water, fun, and adventure right here in our own backyard.  We must be the two luckiest animals in the world.” Mitty purred.  They both closed their eyes and took a rest.  It had been a long, exciting day and it was only noon.  Who knew what challenging events the rest of the day held for the two friends? Yes, a good nap was definitely in order.\nTHE END\nCopyright 1997"

Don’t worry!”\nAudrey noticed the temperature had dropped swiftly in the last few hours. A few snowflakes danced around floating softly to the ground. “I can’t wait for the first snowfall,” Audrey exclaimed, catching snowflakes on her tongue–they melted instantly. “If there is enough snow, I’ll go sledding tomorrow.”\nWaving to Aunt Iva, she sprinted towards home. Giggling silently to herself, she thought of the possibility of no school tomorrow. Snow days were fun!\n“Henson, where are you?” She called hurrying through the yard. “Time to come home dog.”\n“Hoo, hoo,” an owl answered from a chestnut tree. Everything was still except the owl. Audrey shrugged and continued to jog. Henson usually followed her everywhere, but he often got side tracked by his nose and it wasn’t unusual for him to go home. I don’t blame him if he went home earlier, Audrey thought.\nThe sun slowly disappeared behind the hills. Audrey shivered in her coat. The cold air chilled her bones!\nThe one-mile hike leading home through the woods was familiar, but she never walked the hike late in the evening.\nReaching the opening that led deep into the forest, she paused. A lump formed in her throat. In the fading light, the path was darker than ever. The snow began to fall heavily and she calmly took a deep breath. In order to reach home before dark, she had to hurry.\nEntering the woods, her footsteps crushed the dead leaves carpeting the ground. The inviting sounds of crunching leaves were usually calming, but as the evening progressed, the bare tree branches seemed to reach out and try to snag her coat as she passed.\nA tapping sound startled Audrey and she looked up at the tall trees casting twisted shadows everywhere. A woodpecker pecked bark of a rotting tree, busily hunting for insects. Breathing deeply, and then chuckling at her own wild imagination, she continued to walk.\nThe snow plummeted suddenly, blinding her vision more than a few feet in front of her. Increasing her pace, she tripped over a hidden log in the path and fell to the ground. Breathless and a bit shaken, she reached down and rubbed a sore spot on her leg. A pointy branch had ripped her pants and scraped her exposed skin.\nGrabbing onto a nearby tree, she pulled herself up. Luckily she wasn’t hurt too badly. The thought of being trapped in the cold, dark woods gave her goose bumps.\nUnfamiliar sounds echoed behind her and she glanced back on the forest path that faded in the dark.

Television and books added to her active imagination, but she remembered it was fantasy. Just creative stories written to entertain people, but the crunching sounds kept closing in. Audrey nibbled her fingernail, while quickening her pace. A lot of noisy animals lived in the forest.\nA flock of birds shooting out of a thicket of bushes stunned her, and she darted and scampered over limbs and rocks. No sound escaped as she tried to scream–her dry throat was frozen.\nPanting heavily, Audrey stopped to catch her breath. Glancing around, she realized she was off the path. The landscape looked unfamiliar. She must be lost! Puffs of her breath surrounded her in a cloud of fog. Collapsing on a nearby log controlled her shaking legs. “I’m lost. I have to think clearly.”\nAs she thought about whom or what was following her, her breathing returned to a normal rhythm. “That’s it!” she shouted and leaped up from the log. Henson! Henson was following her!\nCupping her hands around her mouth, Audrey yelled. “Henson!” Her voice echoed throughout the woods.\nCrunching sounds in the distance came toward her and Audrey clenched her fists at her sides. Was she mistaken? Was she in danger? Within moments, Henson appeared. Dashing over a log, he barked and leaped into her arms, covering her face with wet, slobbery kisses.\n“I’m lost, Henson. I let my wild imagination get me in trouble,” Audrey said, stroking Henson’s ears. “You know the way home, boy. Please help me!”\nHenson bounded out of her arms. Audrey followed the dog and hoped he would lead her home and not toward a fidgety rabbit.\nWithin moments Audrey heard the distant hum of a tractor.

    "text": "Once upon a time, there was a fish named George. He lived in the water, as all fish do but something was different about George, he did not like the  water. He swam and swam around in the water, and every place he swam, he would find something that he did not like. First, he said that the rocks were to big, then he said that the rocks were too small. Nothing would please  him. The other fish in his school, all fish belong to a school, would try to cheer him up. They did not understand why he was unhappy. They loved swimming around in the shallow water and being together.\nThe school lived in the inter-coastal waters of South Florida. This water  was full of life and warmth. There was always plenty of food and activity and there was never a dull moment for these fish. However, for some reason, George felt restless and discontent and he wanted more. One  day, a big, old and wise fish came to visit his school. He listened intently. The old and wise one was telling of vast waters and limitless swimming. He was telling of great whales and big fish. He was also telling about  great light and darkness. Suddenly George wanted to experience this too. The other fish in his school were not interested but George was eager. He swam with the big fish towards these vast waters with great  dreams. He did not know where he was going but he trusted the older and wiser fish..\nSoon the water began to feel cold and he was seeing giant fish that looked very hungry. He would have been afraid for his life, but he was  much too excited by the new sights. Soon they came to a cave and they found a safe place for the night with food nearby.\nGeorge liked it in the cave. It was very quiet and he could hear calming sounds. Melodious sound seemed to be coming from a long distance.  Even when the big fish swam away, George decided to remain. This was against all normal fish instinct, as fish wants to be with other fish. However, as I said earlier, George was not a normal fish. The melodious sound  fascinated him and he could not stop listening to it. He even began to distinguish the different tones and types of sound. He listened and he listened. He did not eat or move because he was so busy listening. The more he  listened, the more he began to understand about who he really was. The more he listened, the more he fell into a different awareness and soon he forgot that he was a fish and that he did not like the water.\nOne day the big and wise fish was swimming by the cave and he thought about George, so he went into the cave. There he found George just  where he had left him quite some time ago. George had changed however, and did not look the same at all. He was shining in a special way and his breathing was extremely slow. George recognized the old and wise fish and welcomed  him.\nGeorge was now also old and wise and the two left the cave together.\nBy Acharya E.T."

    "text": "One day Jeffery and some of his friends had sneaked out of their pen and were quite happily eating grass on the river bank, when two huge dogs who were out for a walk with their master, came charging toward the geese at a tremendous speed. They were going so fast that they slipped on the dew-covered grass and skidded straight into the river scattering the geese as they went. As they hit the river a duck shot straight up in the air and flew out into the centre of the river landing in the water trying hard not to show his disgrace at being caught off guard.\nWith this Jeffery and his pals burst out laughing–they laughed so hard that they almost split their sides and in doing so they didn’t notice the dogs pulling themselves out of the river and shaking themselves dry. The geese only just made it home as the now recovered dogs flew headlong at them, but yet again they skidded and this time crashed into the wire fence and caused such a commotion that the farmer came to see what was happening.\nThe farmer was cross at the geese for getting out of their pen but he was more cross at the dogs’ owner for not keeping them under control. The farmer yelled at the man that he should respect the country code, it was there for a reason not just for the sake of it. With this he fired his shot gun in the air which scared the dogs who ran back to their master with their tails between their legs.\nThe farmer went back into the house in a huff only to return several minutes later with the feeding pail. As he proceeded to feed the geese and other poultry, Jeffery whispered to his friends, “When he goes in again, how about some of that grass out there for afters?” “No way!” the others cried, as they were too scared the dogs would return.\nJeffery wasn’t too upset as that meant all the more grass for him. To which the others said, “he is mad!” They all knew that the last bird who broke the rules too often ended up locked up in the small coop. Jeffery continued to break all the rules and within the week he was locked up in the smallest coop all by himself.\nJames\nã2000"

    "title": "A Winterburgh Tale",
    "author": "Dougie Campbell",
    "text": "CHAPTER ONE\nPeter Fox was a small, brown, furry fox who lived on the edge of the forest of Winterburgh. There were lots of animals in Winterburgh but Peter’s special friends were Alan the Hare and Billy the Stoat.\nIt all happened on July the 23rd 1996. It seemed a strange sort of day. Peter, Alan and Billy were all walking together in the wood, when a funny thing happened.\n“I don’t like this!” said Billy. “Neither do I,” said Alan. Both Alan and Billy sensed danger in the air.\n“What is it?” asked Peter. “Look up in that tree,” gasped Alan.\nA large grey creature with bright yellow eyes, long pointed ears and a curled down nose was sitting high up in the old oak tree.\n“I don’t like this at all!” exclaimed Billy.\nSuddenly, all was quiet. The long green grass was still and the leaves had stopped dancing in the wind.\n“Don’t move,” said Billy. They didn’t.\nThe curious creature jumped down from the tree and looked at them, as though he was ready to pounce on them.\n“What is it going to do?” asked Billy. “Don’t you mean, what are they going to do?” Peter said.\nBilly turned around slowly to see where Peter was looking. To his amazement, there was another of the creatures in the tree beside them. One of these strange animals was enough to scare Peter and Alan but two made them very, very scared.\nThen the creature spoke.\n“I will not harm you,” he said meekly, “My brother is slightly frightened by you, I am too. We only fight if we are really scared, so if you will just go away, please, we will not harm you.”\nPeter, Alan and Billy were so glad to hear this that they shouted, “Thank you very much,” and ran off as fast as their little paws could carry them.\nCHAPTER TWO\nAfter his first encounter with the creatures in the forest, Peter the Fox developed a will for adventure.\nHis friends did not want to go back into the middle of the forest, but he soon encouraged them with thoughts of friends and fun instead of fright and fear.\nPeter, Alan and William (that was what his mum and dad called him) were by no means the only animals in Winterburgh. There were squirrels, rabbits, hedgehogs, deer and badgers, and many others but Peter, Alan and Billy decided to add two more friends to their list. Even though they had been scared of them at first.\nThey trotted on until they came to the spot where they had last seen the creatures.\nFinally, they spotted one of them. He seemed to have lost his fear of the forest animals and appeared pleased to see the fox, the hare and the stoat.\n“Please do not run away,” the creature said. Peter, Alan and Billy did not run away.\n“What is your name?” asked Billy.\n“My name is Zolan,” the creature said.\n“Where is your brother?” asked Alan.\n“My brother has gone home,” Zolan said.\n“Where do you come from?” asked Peter.\n“I come from the Centre of the Earth,” said Zolan. The three friends gasped with wonder.\n“What is the centre of the Earth like?” they all asked.\n“To you,” told Zolan, “It would seem dark and horrible because your flowers are so beautiful, your grass is so green and your sky is so blue. My mum and dad sent me and my brother here to see what your country is like.”\n“Do you want to leave your own country?”\n“My country is too dangerous to live in now,” said Zolan, sadly.\n“Why?” asked Peter.\n“We get very thirsty because it is so hot and something is making the water dirty so we can not drink it. We do not eat anything, only drink, so we will starve if we do not find a new home.”\nPeter, Alan and Billy were shocked. They were all thinking how they would feel if they had to find a new home.\nThe next day, all three animals rose bright and early, washed their faces, combed their fur and ate all their breakfast.\nIt was agreed that they would meet at the big oak tree. First there was Billy, then Alan and Peter came along together. When they reached Zolan’s tree there was a note pinned to it.\n– Moved. To the 5th oak on the right –\n“I wonder why he has moved there?” they all said.\nWhen they reached the 5th oak tree they noticed a big hole in it.\n“So that’s why he moved,” said Alan, “Zolan has moved to a big tree so that his family can move in with him when they arrive.”\n“What shall we do?” said Peter and then they all laughed because the answer came from inside the tree. It was Zolan.\n“Just being here is fun!” he giggled.\nCHAPTER THREE\nZolan had told Peter, Alan and Billy so much about his family that they could hardly wait to meet them.\nWinterburgh had never been so exciting. There was much to do to prepare for Zolan’s family arriving. He told them that he was going back to the Centre of the Earth tomorrow to help his parents pack their belongings. Peter, Alan and Billy begged him to take them with him to help.\n“Very well,” said Zolan, “but only if you get permission from your mum and dad.”\nPeter, Alan and Billy ran off right away and, of course, their parents agreed that they could providing they didn’t talk to any strangers . . . The next morning they all set off for the Centre of the Earth.\n“How long will it take?” Billy asked.\n“About half an hour, your time,” said Zolan.\n“Will we be able to stand the heat?” said Alan.\n“Yes,” said Zolan.\nOn the way they passed deep, dark caverns, stone icicles and swirling murky water.\nThey felt like they had been travelling for hours. “Not far now,” Zolan said.\nWhere Zolan lived, it was not very hot because it was not too far from the Earth’s crust, but Peter, Alan and Billy could understand why he wanted to leave. The water there was very dirty indeed. The animals in Winterburgh would never drink water that dirty.\n“We’re here!” Zolan said excitedly.\nHis family were kind and friendly and asked many questions about the forest. Peter, Alan and Billy told them all about Winterburgh and its tall trees, beautiful flowers and most of all, its fresh running streams.\nSoon it was time to leave. By the time they got back home it was dark, and past everyone’s bedtime.\n“See you all tomorrow,” said Zolan. “Thank you for a lovely day,” they all said.\nCHAPTER FOUR\nIt was a bright, sunny morning. Peter, Alan and Billy were already out of their beds and ready to go.\nZolan was getting ready too. He had a lot of work to do chopping pieces of wood out of the old oak tree to make two houses, one for his parents and the other for him, his sister Cotra and his brother Zapp.\nWhile Zolan was working hard fixing up the houses, Peter, Billy and Alan were making their way through the wood to help prepare for his parents arrival.\nWhat Zolan did not know was that the animals had arranged a surprise party for that night.\nThey spent the morning tidying up and when they came back from lunch, Zolan’s family had arrived. They were amazed at the beautiful countryside and how there was so many things to do.\nLater in the evening, Zolan and his family were sitting quietly, gazing up at the twinkling stars when all sorts of animals started to come from miles around.\nPeter, Alan and Billy came with their families.\nSquirrels, Rabbits, Frogs and Hedgehogs came. They brought their parents, friends and relatives. Glow worms were invited to sit on the branches of the oak tree to light up the party.\nEveryone danced, laughed and sang until almost dawn.\nThe old wise owl, sitting on top of the tree, blinked in amazement. He had never seen such a party in Winterburgh and he had lived there for a long, long time.\nWhen it came time for each of the animals to leave for home, tired but happy, Zolan’s family thanked them all, then went off to bed, so happy they had chosen the best place in the world in which to make their new home.\nThe End\nAny comments or suggestions, please email: dougie@tales.abelgratis.com\n© Dougie Campbell 1997"

    "text": "“I’m the cutest!” Baxter Bear said to Billy Bear. He was certainly a very handsome teddy bear. His fur was soft brown and he wore a purple sweater and straw hat.\n“I’m the cutest!” Billy Bear insisted. He too was a very handsome teddy bear. His fur was snow white and he wore a red sweater with little glasses on his cute teddy bear face.\nThey were sitting on Cindy’s bed. The little girl loved them very much and always took good care of them. She wiped them with a soft cloth everyday and changed their sweaters all the time. She let them sleep in bed with her at night. She had a tea party for them every Saturday afternoon. She even took them to Grandma’s with her when she went to visit.\nThe two teddy bears had been content with this arrangement for quite some time. Lately, they both thought that maybe one was better than the other.\n“I don’t wear yucky glasses the way you do,” Baxter pointed out to Billy as they sat on the bed waiting for Cindy to come home from school.\n“I don’t wear a silly straw hat the way you do,” Billy pointed out.\n“You wait”, Baxter said. “When Cindy comes home from school she’ll pick me up and kiss me first. She always does.”\n“No, she doesn’t,” Billy told him. “I’m the one she always picks up and kisses first.”\n“We’ll see about that,” Baxter said.\n“We’ll see about that,” Billy said.\nThey sat on the bed together waiting for Cindy to come home. They sat on the soft pink blanket all afternoon not saying another word to each other. At one time, they had been best friends but now, they were in the middle of a fight to see who was the cutest. Both thought that he was. Cindy had lots of toys and dolls but Baxter and Billy had always been her favorites. She got them from her grandpa, who died right before Baxter and Billy came to her. They were very special indeed.\nAll afternoon they sat together in silence and then they heard Cindy downstairs. She was home from school! They heard her come bounding up the stairs.\n“We’ll see now,” Baxter whispered to Billy.\n“We’ll see now,” Billy whispered back.\nCindy came running into her bedroom and threw herself down onto the bed. She was adorable in her brown pigtails. She had freckles on her nose and was missing her two front teeth. Baxter and Billy remembered when she put the teeth under her pillow so that the Tooth Fairy would come and visit her. The Tooth Fairy had left her two dollars and she had brought the straw hat for Baxter and the glasses for Billy.\nShe picked both of them up at the same time and hugged them together. “How are my two favorite boys doing?” She gave them each a kiss on the cheek. “I have such wonderful news to tell my darlings! My other tooth is loose and that means the Tooth Fairy will be coming to visit again. When she does, I’m going to buy you boys a nice little teddy bear bed that you can share. Mommy said that she will help me pay for it because she knows how much I love my babies.” She kissed them again. “Now, darlings, I’m going to get my milk and cookies. You boys behave and I’ll come back in a little while.” She set them down carefully on the blanket and ran back downstairs.\nBaxter looked at Billy. “Maybe we are both special.”\nBilly looked at Baxter. “Maybe we are both the cutest teddy bear to Cindy.”\nThey smiled at each other and sat on the bed waiting for her to eat her snack and then come back and play with them.\n©2002 Debbie Bailey"

    "text": "Marvin was a little white mouse about two years old. He was one of a litter of 29 other mice. His mom was always worried that he was going to get hurt. He was so curious about the world “Curiosity killed the cat,” she warned. Marvin never really listened to his mother’s warnings. The world was just too big to be ignored.\nMarvin lived in a small hole in a wall of a house. The owners of the house just moved out and new humans moved in. The little mouse ran around curiously. He never saw so many wonderful new things. The old humans that lived here didn’t own so much stuff.\nThere were so many treasure to explore. Where to start, Marvin didn’t know. Then he saw it! He neve saw anything like it before. What was it?\nIt was big and black and round. It had three holes on the top. Marvin the little mouse wanted to explore more. “What was it used for? he thought to himself. He crept closer. He crawled to the top of the strange object.\nThen something horrible happened to poor Marvin. He fell into one of those big holes.\nIt was so dark and scary. Poor Marvin did not know what to do. He tried to come out but the inside was so slippery he couldn’t climb out.\nIt wasn’t until a human picked up the object that Marvin found a way to escape. You see who ever picked it up made the holes face the floor and Marvin slid right out.\n“That was neat,” thought Marvin after he got over being afraid. He thought it was so neat he decided to do more exploring.\nThe next thing Marvin found was weird looking. It was big, really big and odd shaped too. Marvin remembered the shape of a human foot. It kind of looked like that, but Marvin knew that humans couldnt’ take their feet off. So what was it?\nMarvin crawled inside, it was wet and smelly. Marvin didn’t want to stay very long inside of it. Marvin tried to get out as fast as he could. There was one problem though. A human was near the thing he was in. The human screamed when she saw Marvin. Marvin hated when humans did that, it hurt his ears.\nMarvin knew that the scream would cause the other humans to bring the CAT! Marvin knew that meant he had to run. That is exactly what Marvin did, he ran. Poor little Marvin ran as fast as his little feet could take him.\n“Whew,” he thought once he was in a safe place. “That was a close one.” Marvin made a silent promise to avoid humans at all cost. He also needed to avoid the CAT. Marvin wasn’t stupid, for a mouse cats meant bad news.\nWell, that was over. Time for Marvin to explore more. So Marvin slowly crawled out of his hiding spot and found something he new well. It was cheese and it was sitting on a wood thing. “The humans must have dropped it,” thought Marvin.\nSo Marvin walked up to the cheese and quickly grabbed it. Before Marvin knew what was happening he heard a loud SNAP! Poor Marvin’s tail was caught under a metal bar and boy did it hurt.\nMarvin didn’t know what to do. All he could do was cry. He was scared and alone. Most of all, Marvin was in pain. At first he thought he could maybe wiggle his way out. That didn’t work. Next he tried to pick up the bar. That didn’t work. The he saw a human and knew it was the end.\nThe human picked up the trap with Marvin in it. “Poor little guy,” the man said. He lifted up the bar and freed Marvin. Then he patted Marvin on the head and let him go.\nMarvin couldn’t believe it. He was free. He wasn’t going to be fed to the CAT. He was so happy he walked playfully away. He would always remember the kind man that saved his life.\nMost of all Marvin would remember to be a little less curious.\nThe End\n©2004 Christy Ann Robinson"

    "title": "Puffer Bunny and the Escape to the Meadow",
    "author": "Francis Allgood",
    "text": "Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Puffer Bunny. He was so fluffy that everyone wanted to cuddle him. He lived with some kids in a comfortable bungalow. The kids were named BoBo, Bobby, and Kit. Bobby was especially fond of little Puffer because he had raised him from a baby.\nOne day they were playing in the back yard and Puffer Bunny took off jumping and prancing. He wiggled under the fence and headed off through the pasture behind the house. By the time the kids could get over the fence, Puffer was long gone.\nMeanwhile, Puffer had scurried down into a hole and was crawling through a long tunnel. He felt something wet and cold. He held his breath in fear, but when his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he realized he was nose to nose with another little bunny! He let out a sigh of relief! The new little bunny whispered, “My name is Doodlebug.” Doodlebug took Puffer by the paw and led him down through more passages and into a cozy little burrow. His brothers and sisters were snuggled together, all warm and safe. There was Dipsy, Dapper, and Dolly and the baby twins, Digger and Dodger. Puffer was thrilled to see a whole family of bunnies!\nHowever, outside of the little burrow, the kids were worried sick about their little bunny. They saw a little fox trot off into the deep woods. They just knew that the fox had gotten their little Puffer. Bobby cried quietly while Bobo and Kit tried to figure out what to do. BoBo said, “Guys, it’s time we headed home.”\nAll the kids climbed back over the fence and trudged home. The night was long with worry.\nBack in the bunny burrow, Puffer was really enjoying himself. He and Doodlebug slipped out for a little mischief. See Puffer was always exploring and Doodlebug could never say no to an adventure. The two frisky bunnies frolicked towards the woods. Just as they were approaching a rotten log, a rattle-snake slithered up. The two bunnies froze. The snake had the bunnies cornered. Their hearts were pounding so loud that the earth shook. The snake said, “Yum, dinner!” And his body lurched forward at Doodlebug. Quickly, Puffer Bunny jumped over the snake, grabbed the rattle, and shook it with all his might! What a sound it made! That snake jumped up in surprise—which gave the two buddies just enough time to bound on outa’ there.\nDoodlebug’s mom rang the dinner bell just as they were coming back to the rabbit hole. She saw the looks on their faces and gave them each a hearty hug. She had fixed a dinner of cabbage and carrots, and they ate all they could eat. When the fluffy little bunnies finished their dinner, they invited Puffer to spend the night. He was delighted!\nThe next morning, Puffer pranced on home to his little bungalow. The kids were overjoyed that he was safe!\n© Copyright 1999 Francis Allgood"

    "title": "Baby Annie",

    "text": "After Billy and Bevy were married for a while, they had a cute little baby beaver. They were very excited. Her name was Annie. Mama and Papa Beaver were very proud to be grandparents. Lizzie and Randy were proud to be aunt and uncle. Baby Annie was very active, exploring the river and the river bank around their lodge. One day Bevy and Billy were busy doing repairs inside their lodge.\nAfter a while Bevy went out to check on Annie. She rushed back inside and called out “Billy, I can’t see Baby Annie anywhere. We better start looking for her.” Both went our and began looking everywhere for Annie. The whole neighborhood of beavers joined in the search for Baby Annie. Lizzie said to the others “why don’t we use our imaginations to help us, like Shay always does?” “Good idea,” the other beavers replied. Shay is the girl that is their good friend. One beaver said “in my imagination I see Baby Annie floating down the river on a log. She is enjoying herself now but she is getting close to a really big water fall and if she goes over the fall, we will never see her again.” “Let’s not exaggerate” said Papa Beaver. “There is no water fall down river.” Another beaver said “I think she was abducted by green forest creatures that can fly who want her for their own baby because she is so cute. These green forest creatures are not mean, but they live very far from here in a deep forest. Baby Annie will get lost in the forest and she will never be able to find her way home again from there.” “We never heard of green forest creatures that can fly and live in a deep forest,” said Mama Beaver.\n“I know you are all trying to help, but some of your imaginations might be a bit far fetched. And if you are using your imaginations, why not imagine something nice.” Lizzie said “because Baby Annie is so cute, I think a beautiful princess came on a flying carpet and took Baby Annie away to her castle in Beaver Flower Gardens. That is a place with the most beautiful trees and flowers and Baby Annie will be able to play there with all her animal friends. There will be a big swimming pool for them to play in and they will have all the best toys in the world. And Baby Annie will be able to visit her parents every day using a magic flying carpet and all the beavers will be very proud of her.” “I like your imagination,” said Randy. “And when she grows up she will marry a prince and they will live happily ever after in Beaver Flower Gardens.” Mama Beaver said “I don’t think all our imaginations are helping us to find Baby Annie. Maybe we better call on Shay.” Shay is the girl who is a good friend of all the beavers. Lizzie went over to Shay and told her about the troubles they were having. Shay went back with her and talked to all the beavers. “Have you looked in all the beaver lodges?” Shay asked. “Yes we have”, said Papa Beaver. “We have checked out every lodge in our neighborhood.” Shay told them to all spread out and have another look. “I want you to look into every hole in the ground and into every hollow at the base of trees. Also look behind all bushes and in tall grass. She may have gotten injured and is unable to walk.” The beavers all spread out and started looking again. Shay’s imagination told her that all babies like to play and that all babies are very inquisitive. Just maybe Baby Annie explored homes that are not beaver homes and maybe she is visiting raccoons or muskrat that live in the area. She checked out a raccoon den first and was told they had not seen Baby Annie. Next she went over to the home of a muskrat family and knocked on the door. Mama Muskrat came to the door and asked “are you looking for Baby Annie? She is such a delightful child and she has been visiting with us.”\n“I know you enjoy her visit,” said Shay, “but everybody is looking for her and I must take her home now.”\nShay took Baby Annie back to her home and Mommy and Daddy were very happy to see their baby again. After hugging and kissing Baby Annie, they hugged and thanked Shay for finding her. After that incident they kept a very close eye on Baby Annie.\nThe End\nErwin Schalm"

PJ hopped out of his bed onto the green, dew soaked leaves and raced to his mom’s nest nearby.\n“Wake up, mommy, wake up,” PJ shouted with excitement!\n“Good morning, my baby boy”, his mom said. PJ yelled, “Do you know what today is?”\nHis mom teased, “No, what is today?”\n“My Birthday”, exclaimed PJ. “I’m 5 years old today.”\n“Oh,” mom said, “Is it your birthday TODAY?”\n“Mom, you remember, don’t you?” said PJ.\n“Of course I do. It’s my favorite day of the year,” mom said. She pulled out a big box with a bright red bow.\n“Happy Birthday, PJ!”\n“Oh, mom, is this what I think it is?” PJ hoped she had gotten all his hints about what he wanted. A new guitar! The kind that his favorite band plays. Shiny blue and sounding awesome!\nPJ pulled apart the wrapping paper and yanked off the bow. He opened the box and it was…… the guitar! PJ was so happy. He immediately picked it up and started playing. Only to his surprise, it did not sound too good. PJ quickly got discouraged and threw down the guitar. Mom picked it back up and said, “PJ, try again. You’ll never know how good you could be if you give up now.”\nPJ was disappointed. He wanted the guitar, but he did not want to take the time to learn to play it. Reluctantly, so he did not hurt his mom’s feelings, he picked the guitar back up and tried again. It sounded just as bad. He got very upset! “PJ”, said his mom, “never give up. Practice, practice, and practice. Soon you’ll see that you can accomplish any thing you set your mind to.”\nThat night PJ tried again. The day after that he tried again. The day after that he tried again. Each day he tried a little longer and a little harder. Until one day PJ played the most beautiful song on his guitar.\nHis mom had been listening, as she had each day. She was so proud of him for not giving up. PJ and his mom would sit for hours together while PJ played the song over and over until it was perfect! PJ was so proud of himself and his mom was so proud of him too!\nPJ said, “thank you so much for buying me this guitar. I guess you believed in me before I even believed in myself!” PJ’s mom said,” That’s what moms’ are for! With this guitar you will make beautiful music forever. Now what better gift could there be?”\nPJ said, “This is the best birthday gift ever.”\nPJ and his mom sat together on a nest of leaves while PJ played his music as the sun set around them.\nTHE END\n©2007 JeniferCrivaro"

    "title": "The Little Bird Who was Afraid to Fly",
    "author": "Sindy Leah Cashman",
    "text": "Once upon a time there was a little bird named Birdie and she was afraid to fly. She would hide all day and all night in the bushes, mostly because there were these big bully crows that would land on the ground in front of Birdie they would scare her and tease her by squawking “you can’t flyyyy your afraid to flyyyy” and the little bird would be soooo scared she would hide in the dark underbrush of these bushes.\nOne wonderful sunny day a very funny little squirrel named Quirk scurried by and saw the little bird and he asked her “what’s your name and why are you hiding in these bushes”. The little bird replied “My name is Birdie and I am hiding because I’m afraid to fly and those big bully crows tease me” so the squirrel said “would you like to go sit in the tree” the little bird said “yes very much!” so the squirrel sat down and said “hop on my back and I will take you up the tree.”\nSo he did, and everyday since then the squirrel would come by the bushes and the little bird would hop on his back and he would take her up the tree and Birdie would sit on the branch all day long. Quirk would spend the day scurrying and playing around the branches and up and down all the trees in the forest. Birdie would just watch wishing she could play too. Then when it began to get dark the squirrel would bring the little bird back down the tree and would leave her in the dark shelter of the bushes so she could go to bed.\nOn this particular day the little bird said “Quirk would you stay here on this branch with me so we can laugh and play and be friends forever.” The squirrel happily said “yes, I would like that!” so that is exactly what they did they laughed and played, they had been having so much fun. Then the crows noticed the little bird was in the tree and they swooped down and started teasing the little bird squawking, “you can’t flyyyy your afraid to flyyyy you can’t flyyyyy”.\nWell the little bird was so upset that she started flapping her wings and frantically saying “I can too fly, I’m not afraid to fly, I can fly if I wanted to fly, I can Fly If I want too!!!” Quirk couldn’t believe his eyes he was stunned looking at the little bird he exclaimed “Birdie you’re flying, you’re flying!”…the little bird had flapped her wings so hard that she had begun to fly “I’m flying?” she said “I am flying!” she was so happy she flew looped deedoos then up and down and in and out of all the branches. Then she saw it, the tallest tree in all the forest and she flapped her wings as hard as she could and flew all the way to the tippy top of that tallest tree and she sat there so proud and so brave. Birdie wasn’t afraid of flying anymore and she was never bothered by those big bully crows ever again.\nEveryday the squirrel would scurry up the tallest tree in all the forest to meet the little bird and they would laugh and play throughout the whole forest, in and out of all the branches, and up and down all the trees having so much fun, Quirk and Birdie remained best friends forever.\nThe End\nGood Night Little Ones\n©2007 Sindy Cashman"

    "title": "The Bathing Friends",
    "author": "Raju",
    "text": "It was early summer in the forest.  On the mango tree near the foot of the hill lived two parrots.  One day a sparrow visited their area in search f food and sat one of the ranches of the mango tree.  The sparrow is very small and beautiful.  Its presence on the tree attracted the parrots.  One of the parrots asked the tiny sparrow:  Where are you from?\nThe tiny sparrow: I am from the nearby lakeside.  I heard that some new type of worms had infested this tree and I found them here and feasted on them.  But this place is very hot, may be because of the rocky hill adjacent.  Why don’t you join me for the evening bath in the lake?\nEvening bath in the lake – both the parrots inquired surprisingly.\nYes. You seem to have not gone to the lake so far: said the tine sparrow.\nYes. We are excited about it.  But tell us how you take bath, as you are very small?\nNo problem at the edge of the lake it is very shallow and I take bath for several times a day.\nThen please guide us to the Lake.\nIt was already noon and the sun was very severe.  The parrots invited the tiny sparrow to their place on the mango tree to rest and protect it from the very bright sunlight.  As soon as they settled down, they all had fallen asleep. \nWhen the rays of the setting sun touched their eyelids they all woke up and fluttered their wings.  Now its time to take bath and cool down from the effects of the scotching sun: said the tiny sparrow.\nAll three of them headed towards the lake.\nAs they reached the lake, the parrots to their surprise saw thousands of birds taking bath in the lake and some are enjoying their play in the water.  It was a scene that cannot be described.  Soon the tiny sparrow introduced the parrots to its family that was taking bath in the lake and guided them to a safe edge of the lake.  Soon the parrots understood the significance of bathing in the lake and enjoyed their bath thoroughly.  It has become a habit for the parrots to visit the lake thereafter.\nOne day the parrots were late to arrive at the lake.  As they approached the lake they found on the banks of the lake several birds murmuring and watching the several elephants taking bath.  The parrots were also afraid of reaching the lake and joined their friend the tiny sparrow.\nSeeing these birds on the banks of the lake a baby elephant emerged from the group of the elephants taking bath in the lake.  The baby elephant came out and straight it went up to the tiny sparrow.  Some birds got disturbed but the tiny sparrow was not in the company of the parrots. \nHi birds you are so cute.  Are you enjoying watching us in the lake?: asked the baby elephant.\nWe are not enjoying seeing you in the lake.  Your presence in the lake caused us immense disappointment and inconvenience.   This lake has been of great help to us to cool down in this summer. Now we are afraid of entering the lake because of all of you. \nAfter hearing the tiny sparrow the baby elephant too felt sad about their plight.   It stood there for sometime watching all the birds.\nIt went back to the lake and joined the elephants.  The birds watched helplessly.\nIn the lake, the baby elephant started crying.  All the elephants stopped taking bath and circled the baby elephant and started inquiring:\nWhat happened?\nIs there a crocodile?\nDid any one of us hurt you?\nNo: said the baby elephant.  I want you all to watch at the bank of the lake.  elephants\nAll the elephants turned their heads towards the banks and were surprised to see the colourful birds watching back at them.\nWe are bad yelled the Baby elephants.  We should not have caused inconvenience to these birds that are waiting to cool themselves in this summer by bathing in the lake like us. I spoke to them and they are all angry with us and since we are huge they are helpless.\nHearing this the grand parents of the baby elephant felt very proud of their grand child. They kissed the baby elephants and asked:  Darling you have opened all our eyes we should not have caused any inconvenience to these birds, as they too need to chill out.  Now we can go there and ask them to join us.\nNo. No. No.  They are all afraid of us.  The moment any one of you approach them they all will fly away in fear.  I have an idea if you all agree we can follow that.\nTo this, again the grand parents kissed the baby elephant and cuddled it with their trunks.\nWe shall go a bit deep into the lake and leave the banks to the birds to take bath.  We shall not disturb the birds in any way.  Now we shall move in.\nThis proposal received a thumping support from all the elephants.  The bay elephant came out of the lake and again straight went to the place where the tiny sparrows along with its new friends the parrots from the goa tree were sitting.\nHey! I have good news for you.  Look at the lake now.  All the birds looked at the lake that was emptied at its edges.  The elephants moved inside the lake.\nNow listen to me.  I have told all the elephants not to disturb you in any manner.  We all shall take bath deep in the lake and you all can enjoy at the edges – as usual.  Hope this is OK with you.\nHearing this from the baby elephant all the birds fluttered at once.   The tiny sparrow alighted on the trunk of the baby elephant as a mark of its confidence and trust in the words of the baby elephant.  The parrots too perched on the head of the baby elephant and started parroting what the baby elephant said.  Seeing this all other birds too took liberty to approach the baby elephant.  The sudden and lovely touch of the birds giggled the baby elephant.  It is a scene worth watching.\nThe elephants – particularly the grand parents of the baby elephant jumped with joy while watching the birds surrounding their grand child.  Soon the birds and the elephants have become friends and they bathed in the same lake thereafter for the whole of summer, year after year.\n©2007 IVNS Raju"

    "text": "Beansie knew he’d gone and done it again.  He had been playing in the yard with his little sister Mopsie.  The two puppy dogs were very frisky. They were running around and chasing butterflies together.  The bright summer sun beat down on them and once in awhile, they would rest under the shade of the big, old tree or take a sip of cool, clear water.  Mrs.  Johnson had put a big bowl of water for them in the yard so they could take a sip when they got thirsty.\nMrs. J. was lounging on her favorite lawn chair, a book in her hand and a tall, cool drink on the table next to her.\n“Betcha I can run faster than you,” Beansie teased his sister. They were both brown and tan with white tips on their tails.\n“I can beat you, Beansie!” Mopsie told him.  “Girls can do anything better than boys can.”\nThey began to run around the yard together.  They were yapping wildly and having a wonderful time.  And then it happened.\nBeansie lost his footing and crashed into Mrs. J.’s vegetable garden.\nHe toppled over her tomatoes.\nHe pounded on her potatoes.\nHe let loose on her lettuce.\nHe ransacked her radishes.\nHe discombobulated her cucumbers.\nHe got up and shook himself off.  He looked at Mrs.  J.  She was slowly getting out of her chair. She looked like she was about to cry.  Beansie knew how much she loved her garden. She spent hours in there everyday. Her vegetables and flowers were her pride and joy. She loved them so much, almost as much as she loved Beansie and Mopsie.\nHe hung his head down in shame.  He knew that he had just broke Mrs.  J.’s heart.  He felt terrible.  He had now ruined her garden and he knew that she was going to cry.\n“Now you’ve gone and done it,”  Mopsie whispered to him.\nBeansie felt like crying.  He didn’t want to break Mrs.  J’s heart.  She was so good to them, always baking them doggie biscuits  and scratching them behind the ears.  He really loved her a lot.\nMrs.  J. walked over to him and Beansie knew he was in for it.  But then the funniest thing happened.  She bent down and hugged him hard.\n“It’s okay, Beansie honey,” she told him.  “I know you’re a puppy and you like to play a lot.  I’m not mad at  you.  How could I be mad at this adorable face?”\nShe gave him kisses all over his nose and he licked her back.  She began to laugh and pretty soon, Mopsie came over to join in the family  hug.\n“Just wait until Mr. Johnson comes home,” Mrs.  J said. “He won’t be happy!”\nBeansie loved Mr.  J.  a lot too.  Mr. J. was his favorite person in the whole world, even more so than Mrs. J.\n“Don’t worry,” Mrs.  J.  told him. “I’ll just tell him that I did it.”  And she kissed him again.\n©2002 Debbie Bailey"

    "title": "The Breathing Stone!",
    "author": "Raju",
    "text": "In their search for a viable place that offers food continuously a family of squirrels migrated to the lakeside and started living there on the Palm trees.  The favorite place for the kids in this squirrels family is the Palm tree that leans towards the lake almost touching the surface of the water.\nOn the second day of their moving to the lakeside place and living on the palm trees, the baby squirrels found a long rocklike thing floating on the water near the palm tree that leaned towards the water.\nWithout a second thought the three baby squirrels jumped onto the long rocklike thing floating on the water- half submerged.  The squirrels ran all across and they found an up and down movement in the middle of the thing.  The squirrels stood there for sometime to experience the movement and felt happy.  With call of their mother the squirrels jumped back to the palm tree and went away.\nNo sooner did they see their mom, they competed with each other to narrate their unique experience.  One baby squirrel said “ Mom it is a breathing stone floating on the wall.\nNext day it was noon, the crocodiles in the lake had their lunch.  Three of them swam across the lake and reached the other side of the lake where the squirrels live.  The baby squirrels came out with their parents in amazement to find the three long black rocklike bodies floating on the water near the palm tree.  The baby squirrels jumped on to one of the crocodiles with merriment and soon followed their parents.\nAll the squirrels experienced the up & down movement to their joy and returned to their home after an hour or so.\nIn the morning they came out to check whether these three crocodiles look like long black rocks floating on the water.  They did not find any.  As they were preparing for their lunch they saw their old friend Dr.Dove their longtime friend.  All the squirrels shared with the Pigeon their experiences of playing on the breathing black long rock that floats on the lake near the leaning palm tree.  They had compelled Dr.Dove to have lunch with them.  Soon after having the lunch the baby squirrels lead Dr. Dove to the leaning palm tree.  They found – this time – six black long bodies floating on water.\nThe squirrels were lost at the sight of this.  Dr .Dove understood the reason for their exhilaration.  It took some time to dissuade them to continue playing on the floating crocodiles in the water.\nOnce the squirrels came back to the palm tree Dr. Dove told them the reality.\nYou were living in the middle of the forest so far and have not seen the crocodiles that live in big lakes, streams in the forest and prey on animals that pass through.  Now I shall prove how they look like.  Saying this Dr. Dove started looking in all directions.  The squirrels were yet to come to terms with what Dr. Dove described. \nIn the meantime Dr. Dove spotted an elephant.  elephants\nDo not go anywhere and stay here.  I shall bring that elephant here to help you see the crocodile.  In a few minutes time Dr. Dove returned by sitting on the scalp of an elephant that holds a big stick with its trunk.crocodile\nPlease disturb these crocodiles with this stick My Dear Elephant – said Dr. Dove\nThe elephant executed its request by giving a jolt to the crocodile that floats in the middle of six.  With this the crocodile surfaced its huge long mouth and opened it in a swift movement.  This sudden movement, made the remaining 5 crocodiles move towards the stick.  Thus they have shown their full bodies to the squirrels.\nThe squirrels got frightened with the movement of crocodiles and requested Dr. Dove to bring back Mr. Elephant.\nWith in a few minutes the crocodiles calmed down. One of them came out and said:  Actually we feel the feather touch of these little squirrels when they play on us.  We do not eat them.  They can play on us when we come here to rest after lunch.\nThe baby squirrels jumped with joy and said:  Thank you crocodiles. You do not frighten us when you sleep.  But sleep always by floating near this palm tree that leans to the water.\nThe crocodiles laughed and said OK; and submerged into the water.\nThe elephant felt happy for the gesture of the crocodiles\nThe squirrels family thanked Dr. Dove for the help it rendered to educate them.squirrel\nAs it was noon and sun was severe all of them rested in the shade of the nearby banyan tree.\n©2007 IVNS Raju"

And since this is one of the best stories, it has to start with ‘Once upon a time,’ too.\nOnce upon a time, there was a little girl named Morgan.\nEvery afternoon a great big Bear would appear in Morgan’s room.\nThe Bear would growl,\n               and snarl,\n               and roar\n               (the Bear had a terrible roar)\nAnd every afternoon, Morgan would give the Bear a great, big  hug.  Or as big a hug as a little girl can give, which are surprisingly big.\nOne day Morgan thought she saw the Bear getting smaller.  And the next day, and the next.  A little bit smaller every day.\nEach day the Bear grew smaller, he roared a little less, he snarled a  little less, and growled a little more softly.\nAnd smiled just a little more\nAnd as the Bear grew smaller and smaller, Morgan grew just a little  bigger each day. And smiled even more than she ever had before. Until the day she could hold the Bear in her arms.\nPart the Second\nMorgan and the Bear played every day.\nThey had tea parties.\nThey played dress up.\nThey went on adventures.\nThe Bear stopped growing smaller.  But Morgan kept growing bigger  and bigger.\nAs Morgan grew bigger, Bear started losing parts of himself.  A bit of fur here and a blot of ticking there. A small piece of his nose came off one time during and explore.  But he didn’t mind. He like giving up pieces of himself in his love for Morgan.  Just as she had given him unconditional lover when he would roar, and snarl and growl.\n Part the Third\nAs time went by, Morgan and Bear played together less and less.\nBear missed her some, but he was getting old and tired and with  all his missing pieces he just didn’t feel like playing as much anymore.\nSo he sat up on a quiet shelf and rested.\n               And watched.\nExcept, of course, for those times when Morgan wanted to play.  For he was glad of the attention.\n More time passed.  Morgan went to school.  Made other friends. And played with Bear even less.  Oh, she’d take him down from his shelf from time to time, dust him off, give him the hugs he  adored, show him to a friend.\nAnd Morgan would return him to his shelf and his shelf like thoughts.\nPart the Fourth\nOne day, Bear noticed that he hadn’t seen Morgan in a long time.  His eyes were going, and he couldn’t see very well.  His hearing was going, and he couldn’t hear very well.\nTo his great joy and surprise, Morgan came.  She gave him a hug  and placed him gently in a box.\nA box. Black and dark and dry.  With tissue paper around him.\nPart the Fifth\nHave you ever noticed how all the best stories end with ‘And they  lived happily ever after’? And since this is one of the best stories, it has to end with ‘And they lived happily ever after,’ too.\nLittle Morgan grew into a beautiful and big Morgan.  Tall, dark,  graceful, and slender as a reed.\nOne day, when she was grown, she met a man and they fell madly  in love. Eventually they got married and had a little girl. The little girl was named Hunter.\nEvery day a great big bear would appear in Hunter’s room.\nThe Bear would growl,\n               and snarl,\n               and roar\n               (the Bear had a terrible roar)\n And every afternoon, Hunter would give the Bear a great, big hug. \nAnd they lived happily ever after.\nThe End\nDavid Harper"

    "title": "The Return of the Birds",
    "author": "Raju",
    "text": "A group of birds living on the banyan tree in the forest got an unusual guest from the nearby city.  It is a sparrow that got stuck in the tarpaulin of an empty truck headed towards the forest.  As soon as the tarpaulin was dragged to load the forest produce, the sparrow freed itself off and perched on the nearby banyan tree.\nThis sparrow was confused to see trees and hills everywhere and wondering what to do.  Noticing the sparrow in this state, a sparrow on the nearby branch tried to comfort it by asking “ are you new to this place?”  The city sparrow answered simply “ YES I am from the city”.\nDo you want something to eat? – the forest sparrow asked again\nYes – said the city sparrow\nThen come along with me, I shall help you find some worms to feed on.\nGrains to feed on? – Questioned the city sparrow\nYes, do you like them most? – asked the forest sparrow.\nNo, we do not eat worms; we eat cooked rice, various preparations that people make in excess and through them in the dust bins.  These preparations are very taste and we eat them – said the city sparrow.\nWith this, the forest sparrow got interested in the kind of food that is available in the city and started asking many questions.  The final question being:  Suppose I also come to city along with my family, would there be sufficient food to eat?\nYes, there is lots of food being wasted every day before the back of several good hotels. You can certainly come, if you wish.\nWith the narration of various foods that the city sparrows get to eat, the forest sparrow has decided to migrate to city along with its family and its kith and kin, if they too are interested.\nBoth the sparrows returned to the banyan tree after eating some grains in the nearby wheat field.  By that time all other sparrows too have returned to the rest for a siesta after lunch.  The scene encouraged the forest sparrow that accompanied the city sparrow to speak about the city life.  The city sparrow spoke at length and mesmerized all.  By evening, all the sparrows living on the banyan tree have decided to migrate to the city.\nThe truck that came in the morning was getting loaded with the forest produce – tamarind, various roots, fruits, flowers, some logs and bamboos.  The sparrows spotted this and decided to board the same to go to the city.\nThe truck started in the evening and soon the sparrows started perching on the roof of the cabin one by one. The city sparrow asked all the sparrows to fly off as soon as the truck enters the city.  No sooner the truck entered the city – in the early hours of the day – did the birds fly off from it.\nAll the sparrows gathered on a neem tree near a big building.  The city sparrow heaved a sigh of relief and said: I am back in the city.  The forest sparrows were amazed at the streetlights, the avenue plantations and the shining roads.  As the day breaks the forest sparrows found several birds flying over the large round units (dust bins) to feed on the leftovers of the food wasted last night.  The city sparrow ordered at the forest sparrows to go and feast on.  With a full night journey, the sparrows got tired and felt very hungry.  They found some remains falling on the floor and ate them fully.  The food was really very tasty – the forest sparrows felt.\nBy 7.00 am the activity in the city got increased.  The sparrows settled on the nearby avenue plantations to witness the life of the city.  By 9.00 am the city was abuzz with vehicular traffic, vendors, people and stray animals.  The forest sparrows found it difficult to breath the air as it is thoroughly polluted with emissions from the motor vehicles.  The atmosphere got heated up.  The forest sparrows felt further suffocated.  They searched for a good source of water to drink in vain.  They had to get contended with the muddy water or the droplets from the leaking public taps with much difficulty.  They could not sleep nor could they rest.  They became restless. The impact of pollution (air, water and sound) again started increasing at 4.00 pm and reached its peak at 7.00 pm.   By that time the forest sparrows experienced the hell.  By 10.00pm the rush on the roads vanished, the shops were closed but the glaring street lights pose another threat to the sleep of these forest birds.\nHow do you sleep in this city that has not night time? – wondered a forest sparrow.\nIt is quite OK with us.  You all can get used to it soon – said one of the city sparrow.\nTo hell with your city, I am back to the forest on my own – said the forest sparrow that befriended first with the city sparrow in the forest.\nWe too shall follow you – yelled the all other forest sparrows.\nAt dawn the forest sparrows started their journey back to the forest.  As soon as they reached the forest, they took bath in the large lake, played for sometime and fed themselves on the insects and worms that are trying to infest the nearby mango trees.  After having the food to their stomach full, they started praising – how beautiful this forest is and how healthy the life in the forest is. \nThat day they had a long nap and were woken up by a group of different birds.\nWhere had you gone in that truck?\nWhy did you return again to the forest?\nWill you go back again in that truck?\nSilence – said a sparrow.  I shall answer all your questions but let me tell you first “There is no life in the city for birds like us”\n ©2007 IVNS Raju"

    "text": "It was early in the morning.  The Little bird woke up with the sudden increase in the volume of her mother’s voice.  The little bird came out of the nest and heard her mother scolding her sister for not dusting her nest.  The words of scolding appealed this little bird like a sweet music on that day.  The entire day it had used these words – you stupid, dirty fellow, rascal, useless fellow, lazy creature, filthy animal, etc.\nThe way it uses these words to scold amuses others rather than hurting them.\nLike a wild fire the news about the amusing way of scolding by this little bird has spread in the forest.    The animals big and small, the big birds, even the big insects have planned to visit this bird and get scolded by it.\nOn the second day came the elephant – the first animal to get the scolding from this little bird.  The little bird scolded the elephant continuously for three minutes.  Seeing this little bird scolding, the elephant rolled on the floor with peels of laughter.  Seeing the elephant in that condition the little bird further added some unknown words to add to the abuses.  This made the elephant gasp for its breath.\nThe elephant spread the news of the amusing way of scolding by the little bird further by adding its own experience.  The entire forest has been buzzing with this news and the several animals including the lions have started journeying towards this little bird’s place.\nSeveral animals waiting to see the process of scolding keenly surrounded the neem tree on which this little bird lives.   Since the Lion was the king there, it has decided to get the scolding first.  The mother of the little bird, brought the little bird and made it sit on a small stone. The lion approached the little bird and greeted by waving its head front and back.  The little bird got annoyed and started scolding it as usual.\nThe lion was not able to control its laughter.  Seeing the struggle of the lion all the animals watching this unique scolding event started laughing.  The lion’s laughter increased and ended with a big roar.  That made the little bird to stop scolding and it hugged its mother saying, “I shall never scold any one from now on”\nAll the animals scolded the lion for this and disbursed to their places\n ©2007 IVNS Raju"

    "text": "One day a tiger felt that it was more powerful than the lion and wanted to challenge the lion.  It went near the lion’s den and started shouting and making all kids of sounds.  It was noon and the lion was fast asleep after a meal.  The sounds created by the tiger woke up lion. \nWho is there?  Shouted the lion.\nThere was no reply but the shouts of the tiger increased.\nThe lion came out of its den and stood in front of the tiger that was shouting continuously.liontiger\nStaring deep into the tiger’s eys the lion asked: Why are you disturbing me, you can go to any other place in the forest and shout as loudly as you can.  But I never allow you to disturb me any more.\nThe tiger looked furiously at the lion and said: Look this forest belongs to all and so is this place too.  You have no right to ask me to vacate this. I shall continue to be here and shout, as I like.\nIn the meantime an elephant that was passing by noticed the argument between the tiger and the lion and came.\n‘Stop quarrelling.  What is the problem. Let me know,’ demanded the elephant.\nThe lion explained the reason and the tiger stood to its stance.  The elephant felt helpless to resolve their conflict.\nThen came Dr.Dove.  It has inquired from the elephant:  What is going on here?  Generally I do not see a tiger and a lion together?\nThe elephant reported the matter briefly.\nThat’s the entire problem? Yelled Dr.Dove.  \nThe elephant was surprised at the casual attitude of Dr.Dove. \nDon’t you think it is not a problem at all? : The elephant asked.\nYes it is very much a problem but not at all a difficult one to solve.  The elephant got further perplexed with this response from Dr.Dove.\nDr.Dove now took the lead and starting flying in-between the tiger and the lion.\nThe tiger and the lion got disturbed with this.\nSeeing them giving a pause to their loud arguments, Dr. Pigeon proposed:  Dear friends you can solve the problem.\nHow both the tiger and the lion shouted.\nVery simple the tiger can continue to shout and the lion can continue to sleep: said Dr. Pigeon.\nYou stupid Dr.Dove.  You are fit only to pull out the thorns from the feet, clear dust from the eyes and treat cut injuries of the animals but not the problems like this – yelled the lion.\nThe tiger joined the lion and said:  leave us alone we shall solve our problems ourselves.\nNo my dear friends, please listen to me.\nDr. Pigeon requested the lion to follow and enter the den quickly.  The lion thought for a while and then followed Dr.Dove. As the lion entered the den, Dr.Dove took out two lumps of cotton from its kit and approached the Lion.\nMr. Lion please listen to me these lumps of cotton help you proof yourself from the sound pollution being made by the Tiger. Please place these lumps one each in to your ears and experience for yourself.\nThe lion did as suggested and both the lion and Dr.Dove came out the den silently.\nDr. Dove told the tiger:  Mr. Tiger please shout as loudly as you can you will have no objection from the Lion.\nThe tiger shouted loudly and the lion felt no disturbance.\nThe lion retuned to its den greeting the Pigeon by waving its paw.  The tiger got furious at this gesture and continue shouting at its best – also puzzled as to why the lion has become so calm.\nSeeing this confused state of the tiger Dr. Dove told:  Mr. Tiger I told the tiger of your power and advised him not to quarrel with you.  You are more powerful than the lion.  See the lion itself has agreed to it.\nTiger felt very happy and gently stroked Dr .Dove with its claw in appreciation of its help.  Then Dr. Dove told:  Mr. Tiger you should not stay here that too before a lion’s den.  Because seeing you here other animals might feel that you are serving the lion.  So I suggest that you should to that hilltop and live there.\nYes, Dr. Dove I shall follow your advice and I thank you for this: saying this the tiger proceeded to the hilltop.\nThe elephant was thrilled at this sudden change and astonishingly looked at Dr. Dove.\nDr. Dove fluttered its wings and flew towards south.\n ©2007 IVNS Raju"

    "text": "Mrs. Flowers tucked her daughter, Blossom, into bed and gave her a kiss on the cheek.\n“Goodnight, Blossom.”\n” Goodnight, Mommy. I love you.”\n“I love you, too. Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.”\nMrs. Flowers turned off the light and tiptoed out the door.\nBlossom yawned and closed her eyes to sleep.  But in the darkness she heard a noise in the room.  Her eyes flew open as wide as bowling  balls.  She rushed out of the bed and turned on the light but didn’t see a thing.\nWith a sigh of relief, Blossom turned the light back off and jumped back in to bed.  As she closed her eyes again, another sound could be heard  coming from under her bed.\n“Yikes!” she exclaimed and jumped off the bed again to turn on the light.\nLooking around the room, she didn’t see a thing, but stood too afraid to look under the bed. She listened and listened, but the noise was gone.   Maybe it was all in her imagination.\nThis time, Blossom kept the light on and went back under the covers.  After two minutes passed by, she heard a scratching noise under her bed and  knew that this time something was under her bed.\n“Mom!” she cried, “Mom! Come quick!  There’s a monster under my bed!”\nMrs. Flowers rushed into the room and hugged her daughter.\n“What?  A monster under your bed?  There are no monsters in here, Blossom.”\n“Yes, it is—under my bed.”\nMrs. Flowers bent down on her knees, lifted the bed covers and with a giggle reached under the bed and pulled out patches, Blossom’s fluffy white cat.\nBlossom’s eyes went down from being bowling balls back to the size of marbles as she heaved a sigh of relief.  “Patches, you scared me!”\n“meow!” Patches said, blinking from the bright light.\n“You see, there are no monsters under your bed.  It’s just silly old patches trying to get comfortable.”\nBlossom smiled and held patches in her arms.  “I’m so glad that it wasn’t a monster.”\n“Blossom, Mommy and Daddy are right in the next room so you don’t have to be afraid of monsters, okay?  There are no such things!   Now, say your prayers again and this time when you say God protect me from all harm, I want you to believe that he will, okay?”\n“Yes, Mommy.”\n“Now, goodnight and sweet dreams.  Remember, there are no such things are monsters.” \n“Goodnight, Mommy. I’ll remember that.”\nBlossom kneeled down in her bed with patches beside her and began to pray.  “Dear Lord God, I am so sorry that I didn’t believe that you were  protecting me.  I am sorry for being afraid because I know now that you will not let monsters, which Mom says aren’t real, to hurt me.  Please keep protecting me.  And this time I believe that you are protecting  me, in Jesus name—Amen”\n“Meow!” Patches added.\n“And God, I’m so glad that it was Patches Mom pulled out and that there are no monsters under my bed!”\nBlossom cuddled up with Patches and closed her eyes.  She welcomed the sleep that took her to a peaceful dreamland.\n© Sandy D. Forbes"

    "title": "Mitty’s New Friend",
    "author": "Shelly Morris",
    "text": "Mitty the Kitty knelt down. She dug her sharp claws into the ground and wiggled her behind. She was ready to pounce. Her friend Buddy the Butterfly was sipping water from a small puddle near Mitty’s house. He was unaware that she wanted to play. Then quick as the wind Mitty pounced on top of Buddy.\n“Boo friend!” she cooed, as she held Buddy carefully in her paws.\n“Oh Mitty you are so silly. You really scared me.” He carefully crawled out of her grasp and flew to sit on the top of her nose.\nMitty looked cross eyed as she watched him shake out his wings. “Your wings are so magnificent. And you fly so gracefully.” Mitty was truly in awe of her interesting friend.\n“Oh thank you Mitty,” Buddy began. “Well . . . I’ll see you around. I’m having a picnic with Becky the Butterfly who lives in the yard next door. Bye.” And he flew swiftly away.\nMitty strolled to the back porch of her home. The six year old boy came out the door. He reached in his pocket and produced a large slice of turkey. “Here ya’ go girl.” He rubbed her back, then ran quickly away as he opened his candy bar. Mitty loved turkey. “Yummy, what a treat,” Mitty thought as she quickly ate her lunch.\nThe mommy opened the door. Mitty ran to greet her. She was a nice lady. Whenever it was going to rain she would call Mitty into the house. Mitty rubbed against her leg and began to purr. Mitty wondered where the little fellow was. He was always with his mommy. Then Mitty heard a strange sound. ‘Choo Choo’ echoed through the air. Then the sweet, smaller boy ran into the room. He was carrying a noisy toy. He immediately petted Mitty’s nose. The mommy brought a large glass of water outside and poured it into Mitty’s bowl. Mitty ran to drink the sparkling water and the Mommy and boy went back inside. Mitty had a wonderful family. She was thankful for them everyday!\n“Hey, tweet, tweet, what have you been up to?” Mitty looked up to see her good pal Rita the Robin. “I’m just having a cool drink. It’s nice to see you today. I’ve been pouncing,” Mitty answered. “Oh, well, don’t pounce on me. I played that game with you a few days ago and my wings are still sore.”\nJust then, Bob and Betty Bumble Bee flew by. “We’re having lunch in the tulips today,” Bob proclaimed. “Hello, good bye,” Betty said as they buzzed away.\nMitty laid down on the patio and Rita perched beside her. It was a sunny, peaceful day in their own backyard. There were so many special friends who lived here. Then Rita spotted something strange. “Mitty, Mitty, I saw something, at the corner of the house. I’m off to the oak tree. It may not be safe.” Rita flew hastily to the tree. Mitty felt a little nervous. She tip toed to the corner of the house. “What could it be,” she wondered. As she peaked around the corner, she was very surprised.\n“Good afternoon.” A slim, solid colored lady kitty sat staring at Mitty.\n“Oh, hello,” Mitty answered. “I’m Mitty. What is your name?”\n“They call me Gidget. My family and I just moved in two doors down. I came to extend greetings to you.” Mitty watched her. She was so refined and charming. But Rita flew over and she scowled at her.\n“That is my friend, Rita,” Mitty explained to her.\n“You are friends with birds?” Gidget asked as she squinched up her nose.\n“Oh, yes, we play together everyday.” Mitty told her.\n“Kitten, you need to grow up a little. Frolicking with birds is not ladylike.”\nMitty listened carefully to her. She didn’t really agree with her but she decided to keep quiet.\n“Let me show you around the backyard.” Mitty insisted. Gidget strolled thoughtfully through the grass. “What lovely red tulips,” she pointed out.\n“What is red?” Mitty asked.\nGidget glared at her. “Red is the color, you silly kitten. Don’t you know your colors?” she asked. Mitty felt silly. Gidget was so smart and grown up.\n“No, I don’t know my colors. Will you teach me?” Mitty sat down thoughtfully.\n“I would be pleased to teach you. You see everything in color, tint or shade. See those tulips are red.” Just then Bob and Betty Bumble Bee came buzzing out.\n“Hi Mitty, want to play, play?” Betty asked. Gidget wiggled her whiskers at her.\n“We are learning about colors here. Mitty cannot play right now. Now, please leave us,” Gidget instructed. Bob and Betty buzzed sadly away. Mitty thought Gidget had been rude to her friends but she decided not to say anything. “Your small friends were yellow and black.” Then she pointed to the sky. “The sky is blue and the puffy clouds are white. I am all white,” she informed Mitty.\n“What colors am I?” Mitty asked her.\n“You are black with white feet and tummy. You also have white whiskers.” Mitty strutted and wiggled her tail for Gidget. She was proud of her special colors. Gidget laughed. “The grass is green. The trees in your yard have green leaves. Your bird friend is brown.” Just then Buddy the Butterfly flew up.\n“Hi Mitty, who’s your new friend?” he asked.\n“Gidget, I would like to introduce you to my friend Buddy. What color is he?” Mitty asked. Buddy flapped his wings happily awaiting her reply.\nGidget took a deep breath. She seemed annoyed with all the interruptions. “He is orange and black.”\n“Wow,” Mitty exclaimed. “You’re orange and black. I am black, too.” Buddy flew around and around Gidget.\n“Leave me alone, you big fly,” she hissed at him. Mitty was startled. Buddy flew away. Mitty knew she had to console her friend. He was a lovely butterfly not a big old fly. He would take the insult to heart.\n“Gidget, I’d better be going now. Thank you so much for teaching me all about colors. You are a very smart cat. I hope you can come over again sometime. Bye, now!” Mitty ran to the old oak tree where her friends were gathering. Gidget strolled elegantly away.\nBob and Betty Bumble Bee and Rita the Robin formed a circle around Buddy the Butterfly. Mitty hurried over. She could tell Buddy was very upset.\n“Buddy, buddy you have spectacular colors. You are orange and black. Isn’t that wonderful?” He made a sad face.\n“She called me a ‘big fly,'” he whimpered.\n“You are a handsome, dazzling, flawless, orange and black butterfly. And you are my friend. You will always be special to me,” Mitty assured him.\n“Yes, you’re splendid,” Rita interjected.\n“Oh, you are, you are,” Betty agreed. They all smiled. Mitty raised her ears and swished her tail.\n“I learned about colors today. The sky is blue. The clouds are white. My tummy and feet are white. My back is black and some of Buddy’s special markings are black. The grass is green. Rita you are brown. Bob and Betty, you guys are black and yellow. The tulips are red. We will be the most knowledgeable animals in the backyard. And we can teach the others. What a great day!”\nMitty’s friends laughed and shouted “Hooray, Hooray!”\nSuddenly, Rita spotted Gidget peaking around the corner of the house. “Look, Mitty, it’s that unfeeling cat!” They all turned to see her.\n“She must not have any friends. She looks very lonely and sad.” Mitty noticed. “I’ll go talk to her.” Mitty rushed over to her. “Hi, Gidget. What’s wrong?”\n“I’d like to talk to your friends, if I could, please.” She asked cautiously.\n“O.K.,” Mitty answered. They both pranced over to the old oak tree. “Here’s Gidget you guys. She’s the one who taught me all about colors. She is so smart.”\nGidget raised her paw. “I’d like to apologize for being rude to you all. I learned something today, too. Mitty here taught me that I should be considerate of all creatures big or small. And that the way to make friends is to be polite to others. I’m sorry I was abrupt. I’d like to be friends with all of you. Please accept my apology.” All the animals gazed around at each other. But Buddy spoke first.\n“We accept your apology. I know it’s hard to move to a new neighborhood with new animals. We are all very different here in our neighborhood but we are all the best of friends.”\nMitty smiled. She was proud of Buddy for understanding. Bob and Betty buzzed happily. Rita smiled at Mitty. Gidget was truly sincere.\nWelcome to the neighborhood Gidget. I’ll bet there are so many things a smart kitty like you could teach us,” Mitty exclaimed.\n“Yes,” she smiled. “And if I pay attention, I think I could learn a lot from you and your friends, too.” Gidget insisted. Mitty and Gidget shared a gentle hug. New friends were an adventure in themselves.\nTHE END\nCopyright 1997 Shelly Gail Morris"

Just before Nick left, the farmer put a tag on Nick’s ear.  The tag read “Nick”, that way everyone would recognize their little friend.\nTHE END\n[/wr_column]\n\n"

She had a plan. Siberia would invite them over to her house but they wouldn’t know that the other person is coming.\nThe next day Siberia invited them over.

    "text": "Mom and Dad waved goodbye as I stood with Grandma on her wooden porch.  Our blue family mini van disappeared down Old Orchard Grove Lane toward Main Street. They were leaving me for two days.  I started to cry.\n“Don’t cry Thomas.  We are going to have a wonderful time together, just you and I. We have all weekend to play games and read stories.”\nGrandma’s soft voice and smiling green eyes made me feel better. She always smelled like roses.\n“You are almost 7 years old now, and big boys should try to be strong,” she said.\nWe went inside to get some chocolates and milk.\nI sat at the kitchen table and looked at the cats on her wallpaper. Grandma  liked cats.  I counted all the magnets on her refrigerator. Most of them were cats too.\n“Where is Mr.  Bill,” I asked?\n“Oh, that crazy pussycat is probably climbing Mrs.  Swenson’s apple tree again. He gets stuck at the top and can’t get down.  I had to get my ladder out to rescue him the last time.”\n“Can I go outside and play in the yard?” I asked.  “Maybe I can find him and we can chase each other.”\nGrandma told me that was fine, as long as I didn’t go anywhere else.  She opened the back door and said she would be right out after doing the dishes.\nI called for Mr.  Bill, but he didn’t come.  He wasn’t in the apple tree.  I asked the squirrels and robins if they had seen him. No one knew where he was.\nThen I saw him! Mr.  Bill’s fluffy, white, whiskered face was staring at me from the woodpile.  He scampered off running toward the road and down the hill. I followed him, calling “Mr. Bill! Mr.  Bill!”\nDown the hill I ran.  That crazy cat just disappeared, but I kept searching everywhere.  He wasn’t in the bushes or under a car. He wasn’t up a tree or in a garden.  I kept calling and looking, but he was gone.\nThe sidewalk ended and then Main Street was in front of me.  Cars and buses sped by.  Grown ups rushed past me as if I wasn’t there. I was LOST!\nA man with a big nose in a tall white hat was cooking hot dogs, and I could smell mustard and onions.  Yuck! His silver barbecue on wheels  had a green and white umbrella on top.  Two rude ladies wearing hats with purple feathers started talking loud and scared me. I ran away from them, and bumped into a mean looking man with a tattoo on his arm.\n“Come here little boy,” he said. “I want to talk to you.”\nI backed away and tried to remember how to get home.  A blinking ice cream sign made me hungry.  I went into the store and asked the ice cream man if I could have a chocolate cone.\nHe had a long black moustache and wore a white apron with strawberries on it.  He smiled and told me to sit down.  I could see him talking on the telephone.  When he was done, he scooped some chocolate ice cream into a sugar cone for me. His name was Dario.  I told him my name was Thomas and that I was trying to find Mr. Bill.\nA tall policeman wearing a blue uniform with a shiny badge came in and sat down beside me.  He asked if I was lost, and where I lived.  Grandma made me remember. She would say it over and over again.  I told Officer Bob my Grandma lives at 67 Old Orchard Grove Lane, and her phone number is 727-5509.\nHe said I was a smart boy and took me to his patrol car that had a big red light on top.  I buckled my seat belt, and listened to the crackling radio as he drove.\nBefore I could get scared again, Mrs.  Swenson’s apple tree was right in front of me.  Grandma was waiting on her front steps and she  ran to the police car when she saw us.  Officer Bob had taken me home!\nI was hugged and kissed and scolded all at once.\n“Don’t you ever run off like that again,” said Grandma.  “I was worried sick.”\nMr.  Bill was sleeping on the porch. I ran over and gave him a big hug.\n“You little rascal!  Don’t you ever run off like that again,” I said.\nGrandma took us both inside and we played games on the floor all afternoon.  Mr.  Bill kept jumping into the middle of everything.\nI was happy.\nFrom now on, I will listen to Grandma and stay close to home until I am bigger.\n©2002 John A.  Mayer"

    "text": "One day a Little Frog happens to see a buffalo on its way to the pond and is stopped by it.  The little frog got surprised.\nWhat are you doing by jumping like this? Yelled the big buffalo at the little frog\nThis is how I walk responded the frog with a surprise.\nYou have got four legs like any other animal and why can’t you just walk? Buffalo again yelled with the same anger.\nNow the little frog understood the confusion the big buffalo had and it turned upside down and asked:\nLook my dear big buffalo how my legs are made. I do have four legs but the hind ones are differently made hence I can’t walk and I can only jump to cover distances.\nOh I am sorry – pleaded the big buffalo\nI am really sorry for showing my anger at you without knowing the reason.  I shall be your friend from now on wards and I shall carry you now to wherever you want to go.  Please let me know where do you want to go – requested the buffalo\nThe little frog felt very happy with the sudden change in the behavior of the big buffalo.\nI need to got to the pond near that banyan tree but I do not know how to climb on to your back – said the little frog\nDo not worry I shall sit down so that with one leap you can jump on to my back – suggested the big buffalo\nThe frog did as suggested but the smooth skin of the buffalo made its efforts futile.  Both the big buffalo and the little frog were disappointed but continued their efforts.  At one point the frog could jump on to the back of the buffalo but as the big buffalo started standing up it had slipped down.  As their struggle continued they saw Dr.Dove coming towards them.\nWhat’s the matter why are you here asked Dr.Dove by alighting on the branch of a neem tree near them.\nI made a promise to carry this small frog on my back to the pond near that banyan tree but it has become difficult for this small frog to reach my back. \nYou want to carry the frog on your back. Isn’t it? Asked Dr.Dove.\nYes told the buffalo\nThen I have suggestion to you.  You both come along with me lead Dr.Dove towards the pond.  All three reached the pond.\nDear small frog you first jump into the water – said Dr.Dove\nThe small frog jumped into the water and looked up by turning back towards the buffalo and Dr.Dove.\nNow dear Buffalo you walk into the water and sit down in such a way that your back is just touching the surface of the water level in the pond – said Dr.Dove.\nThe big buffalo did as suggested.\nThe little frog understood what is to be done. Immediately it jumped onto the back of the buffalo with ease and settled down there.\nSoon the buffalo too understood and came slowly out of the water with the little frog on its back.  The little frog and the big buffalo were happy and thanked Dr.Dove.\nNow tell me where shall I take you – asked the big buffalo\nNot to the pond again but back to my home in the woods in the north pointed the little frog. \nSeeing their happiness Dr.Dove flew away.\n©2007 IVNS Raju"

    "title": "A Dance in the Forest",
    "author": "Raju",
    "text": "In a very big forest there lived many animals and birds.  One day the some of the birds were discussion about the way the animals live.  The parrot said,  “Look at me I do not eat any bird or animal I just like fruits and eat them all the time.  I hate looking at these animals as they hunt other animals and eat them”.  I feel that we the birds are the best in the forest as we do not eat other birds for our survival”.\nMany birds agreed to this argument and narrated their own opinions:\nThe sparrow said:  I eat the small insects that do harm to others that does not mean that I am like these animals who kill all other good animals.\nThe woodpecker said:  See I protect trees by eating the white ants under their bark.  If I do not do so many trees would have been eaten away by these white ants and other insects.\nThe weaver bird:  You are aware that I am the best in the forest in making the nest.  Show me any animal that can do like me.  These animals are lazy and live like rocks in all seasons.\nThe humming bird said: I drink the nectar from the flowers and while doing so I do not harm the flowers.  If help in pollination and make the forest look colourful with many flowers.\nThus many birds narrated their own stories and ways of living.  Meanwhile they saw a herd of elephants passing under the trees.  The parrot yelled at them: Hey big beasts do you know that birds are the best ones in the forest.  You animals destroy forest, eat other animals and create bloodshed for your survival.\nOne of the elephants responded by saying :  I do not know what you are talking but I can tell this to other animals as I am going to attend the meeting called by the Lion.\nThe Lion – the king of the forest – is sitting on a big rock surrounded by many animals.  The meeting began with the topic “How shall we celebrate the onset of sprint”.  Then the elephant intervened and said:  we feel that we are the great in the forest.  I heard a parrot saying that the birds are the best because they do not eat other birds for their own survival.  Lets first solve this problem and by deciding who is the best in the forest, the birds are we the animals.\nAll the animals got irritated at the statement of the parrot shared by the elephant.  The wolf said: Lets call the birds here and we all can kill them and eat them at once then there is no problem.  Haa Haaa joined the other animals.\nCool down: said the Lion.  If the birds feel that they are the best in the forest, we shall allow them to prove.  They said that they do not eat other birds but it is false.  They do eat other birds for their survival.  You are aware that the eagles are always on the look out for chicks of hens and peahens.  They eat mercilessly all the chicks.  Birds are fools and incapable creatures.  I pity them.   Lets play with them for some time and prove our might.  Dear fox, call all the birds at once here.\nThe fox approached the mangrove and yelled at the birds.  You seem to be having a feeling that you are the best in the forest.  Lets us prove who is best in the forest.  All of you can come to our meeting place near the lake and prove yourselves. \nHearing this the birds felt challenged.  All of them flew towards the meeting place.\nIn the meeting place the most heated arguments took place.\nSeeing the heat generated, the Lion said.  Meeting is adjourned to tomorrow in the morning and asked all the animals and birds to disburse.\nIn the evening the grand old man who often visits forest and help animals and birds by treating them came to the meeting place and asked some of the birds still sitting there:  I heard a commotion in the afternoon what happened to you all.  I heard the loud sounds of animals and birds too. Do you have any problem and  can I be of any help to you?\nThe birds said:  we had problem to solve between the birds and the animals.  We shall prove who is best in the forest.  We argue we are the best but they argue as cruelly as they can for their superiority.  It is good that you have come.  Why don’t you come for the meeting tomorrow and help us.\nThe grand old man said Ok, I shall come tomorrow.\nThe next day morning all the birds and the animals gathered at the meeting place.  The grand old man took some time to arrive.  His arrival was welcomed by the Lion who was once save by the grand old man.  Dear grand old man I am glad that you are here, hear all our arguments and tell us who is the best in the forest.\nBoth the sides amply briefed the grand old man.  The birds and the animals became silent and await the judgment of the grand old man.\nThe grand old man said:   The argument of the birds that they do not eat other birds is both wrong and write. So in the arguments the birds and the animals both win and lose. That makes the problem nil.  The birds and animals got confused at this. Seeing their faces particularly of the Lion’s the grand old man clarified it further:\nThough the hens and pen hens come under the family of birds they live mostly on the ground and they do not fly for their survival they run for their survival so actually come under the family of animals.  The chicks of the birds also do not fly they just run on the ground so they are also animals. Since Eagles eat these chicks it amounts to eating other birds for their survival like the animals do.  Which means birds eat and do not eat other birds for their survival.\nMost important thing is this:  If the animals like Lion, tiger, cheetah, fox and wolf do not eat other animals like sheep, goat, etc the population of these grass eating animals increase making the forest dry and difficult for all to survive.  Similarly the birds help in pollination and cross-pollination, propagation of trees   and help add beauty to the forest.  The forest becomes dull without any one of you.  So neither the birds nor the animals are best in the forest, the forest itself is the best because it gives us food, shelter and protection from the human beings. \nHearing this the Lion said: what a brilliant man are you my dear grand old man. I agree with you that it is the forest that is the best.  The birds do chirped the same opinion.\nThen the squirrel said:  this is the best time to celebrate the onset of spring. Lets dance….\nAll the animals danced and make merry…..\n©2007 IVNS Raju"

    "title": "The Two Squirrels with A Big Coconut",
    "author": "Raju",
    "text": "In a forest there were two squirrels living happily in the coconut plantation.  One day the entire coconut plantation was disturbed by the powerful gale winds.  These winds have swept the ay coconuts fully and in minutes the ground was helter-skelter with baby coconuts.\nThe squirrels felt happy at once but soon realized that all the baby nuts have fallen along with the flowering bunches and for the coconut trees to flower again and for these flowers to become nuts would take quite a time.\nWhat to do?  They ate the coconuts and fell asleep.  After three days it becomes really difficult to eat only the fallen baby coconuts as they taste differently. Along with the baby coconuts some grown up coconuts too had fallen down. They are several in numbers some are very good and ready to consumption.\nThe squirrels tried to peel out the husk of a coconut in vain and they got tired.  Seeing them in that condition Dr. Dove approached them and inquired about their problem.\nOk, do not worry I can help you solve the problem.  All that I want you both to do is to peel out the husk at the back of the nut so that you can drink the water and work further.\nThe squirrels got encouraged with this advice and did as advised.  Soon they found a tender place in the nut that needs to be pierced to access the water.  Then Dr. Dove held the coconut tightly and pierced it with its beak.  The water spilled out.  The squirrels in turn drank the water and felt refreshed.\nNow you should start removing the remaining husk around the nut so that I can help you break it – said Dr. Dove.\nWe cannot break the nut as its shell is very hard: said one of the squirrels.  Do not worry I have an idea for that too.\nSoon the squirrels resumed their work and with in an hour they are about to peel out the husk fully.  Then Dr. Dove asked them to retain the husk at one end in tact.  They did the same way and jumped on the nut and rolled it all around.\nNow we shall bring you a rope and we shall tie it to this nut at its end that has still got some husk.  I have an idea: yelled a squirrel.\nWhat is it? inquired Dr. Dove.\nThere is a money plant that crept on the neem tree nearby it has got several rope like branches.  I can cut one of it and bring it over here.\nSoon the squirrels brought a long rope like branch of a money plant and removed its leaves.\nThe squirrels themselves tied the coconut to the rope like branch of money plant and waited for further instructions.\nPerching on the nearby banyan tree Dr. Dove thought for a while, flew down and picked up the other end of the trimmed money plant branch with its beak and alighted on the same branch. \nCome up and join me : said Dr. Dove\nSoon the squirrels joined Dr. Dove on the branch of the banyan tree. \nNow lets slowly lift the coconut up.  They lifted the coconut up.\nNow lets through it down all at once by holding on to this end of the rope.\nAs the squirrels are getting ready Dr. Dove told them to wait and listen.\nWe must through it down in such a way that it falls exactly on the stone beneath so that it breaks.\nIn the first attempt they failed.  The nut got untied.  They tied the nut again and tried again.\nThe second attempt was a great success.  The nut got broken.\nNow you can go down and feast on….\nSaying this Dr. Dove flew away.\nThank you Dr. Dove you have helped us to learn the trick of breaking these hard coconuts and eat.  You have also helped us to survive.  Thank you so much:  Shouted back the squirrels in joy.\n©2007 IVNS Raju"

    "title": "HAMILTON THE HAMSTER",
    "author": "Paula Moore",
    "text": "By Paula Moore\nOnce upon a time there was a smart little hamster named  Hamilton.  He lived in a butcher shop owned by a man named Mr. Roman.  Mr. Roman didn’t pay much attention to Hamilton. Hamilton had no cage – he went anywhere in the shop he pleased. Mr. Roman would put out some bread crumbs for Hamilton every now and then.  But mostly Hamilton was on his own, scrambling around looking for food and water.\nHamilton was very lonely living like this.  He just wanted to be someone’s pet – to live in a cozy cage with shavings to make a nest, and lots of good crunchy food. Hamilton was tired of being hungry, and he wanted to be loved!\nSo every day, when Hamilton heard the bells jingle on the shop door,  he knew a customer would walk in and look at the meats.  Hamilton would scramble on top of the wooden crates, and yell “Hey Mister!  I’d make a great pet!  Will you take me home?  Hey look! I can do tricks. How ’bout a back flip!”  Then Hamilton would jump up into the air and do a backwards somersault.\nUnfortunately though, customers just didn’t notice Hamilton.  And to a human, Hamilton’s yelling only sounded like “eeeeeh, eeeeeh.”\nOutside on Mr. Roman’s shop window, there were store signs that said  “Pork Chop Special – $1.99 per Pound” and “100% Pure Grain Fed Beef.”\nOne day, like many other days, a man stood outside the shop reading  the store signs. Hamilton had read the signs, too, and was watching the man.  The man came in, looked at Mr. Roman, and said, “Where’s the beef?” And Hamilton, who was very hungry by this time, said “Hey! Where’s the grain?!” But of course he only sounded like “eeeeeh”. Hamilton knew by now he had to do something drastic to get attention. So he decided to make a big sign, too.\nHamilton saw a big purple pen, and he found some poster paper  scraps.  He grabbed the pen, which of course is very long to a hamster, and wrote on the poster paper, “My name is Hamilton, please take me home to be your pet.”  Then Hamilton waved the sign all around in the air. The man saw something moving over to the side of the shop, and there was the little hamster with the sign.\nThe man knew that most hamsters can’t read or write and thought that  this must be a trick. So he said to Mr. Roman the butcher, “Roman, you must be trying to get rid of your pet hamster.”  Mr. Roman said, “Nah, the little guy just hangs out here.”\nHamilton knew this was his chance to be someone’s pet.  So he grabbed the purple pen, turned the poster paper over, and was about to write another message to the man, when the purple ink began to leak all over his paws and fur.\nThe man stared at Hamilton, thinking the Hamster had chewed on the  pen, and he said “What a mess!”  Thinking quickly, Hamilton wrote on the sign, “Pets Are Purple, Too!”\nAnd as the man realized this hamster could actually read and write, he  began to get an idea. This little guy would make a great pet!  The kids would love him!\nWith Mr. Roman’s permission, the man scooped Hamilton up, put him in a  nice box, and took him to a pet store where he bought all the fancy little equipment hamsters need to be happy.  At home, his kids cleaned off all the purple ink and gave Hamilton a teeny little pen and a teeny little notepad. (The first question they asked Hamilton was “What is your name?”)  From that time on, Hamilton lived happily ever after with his new family."

    "title": "The Lion and a Mouse",
    "author": "Raju",
    "text": "One day a mouse was in search of food in the forest.  While searching it came near the den of a lion and smelt something very good.  Guided by the smell, it went inside the den and found several pieces of meat of an animal that was eaten by the lion.  The mouse ate quite a few pieces.  Seeing the many pieces that are left over there, it has decided to stay on so that it can eat it in the night also.  Having eaten so much meat it was fast asleep within minutes.\nIt has become dark and the Lion returned to its den.  Since it was dark it could not see the mouse sleeping on the floor.   The Lion had brought with it a piece of a lamb and ate it fully, leaving the bones aside.\nThe Lion after sometime had slept off and started snoring loudly.  The lion’s snoring woke up the mouse.   The mouse ran helter-skelter and bumped on the lion’s leg.  The mouse felt the fur on the leg smooth and started exploring it.  As it reached the ear of the lion, the lion got disturbed and woke up with a sudden jerk that made the mouse slip down.  Who is here? – the lion roared.  The little mouse with a feeble voice replied, “ I am a mouse here”.  How dare you disturb my sleep and where are you? – again shouted the lion. \nI am sorry and I am here – said the mouse.  The Lion lit a lamp and searched for the mouse.  It found the den very clean with no pieces of meat and bones and finally it saw a mouse in a corner of its den shivering with fear.  The mouse looked pretty.  The lion thought for a while.  It thought that since the mouse was here its den is kept clean otherwise it would be stinking with meat pieces and bones all around.  Why not allow this mouse to be here so that it keeps the den clean by eating away the bones and leftover meat – thus the lion thought about.\nOk tell me why did to enter my den? – The lion continued its question.\nThe mouse replied with folded hands:  I was in search of food and the smell of the bones and meat pieces lead me to your den.   I am sorry, I shall leave now, please allow me go”.\nOk, if you want to stay here you can do so, but you shall not disturb my sleep.\nThe fear of the mouse did not reduce.  So it has repeated:” Please allow me go”. \nSeeing the mouse in that fearful condition, the lion felt sorry for it and said in a very soft tone: Oh little mouse do not get frightened. Just listen to me carefully.  I hunt everyday and bring the carcass of some animal.  I do not eat it fully.  You are a small animal and hence you can easily eat the leftovers and be happy.  If you like eating like this without searching for food, you can stay here.\nThe mouse was surprised and with happiness it said “ Yes Mr. Lion, I shall stay in the den” One more condition: Said the lion.\nYou must keep the den clean by eating all the leftover pieces of meat and bones. If you can not eat fully, you shall carry them away and keep the den clean. \nOK Mr. Lion said the mouse.\nOK now you sleep in that corner and I shall sleep here in the middle of the den: saying this the lion went to sleep.\nBoth the lion and the mouse were fast asleep.  The mouse has a habit of rolling freely on the floor while sleeping.  So, by midnight the mouse came nearer to the lion and started feeling its warmth and went further deep into the sleep.  In the sleep it started comforting itself by placing itself in the fold of the lion’s leg.\nThe lion too felt it OK and adjusted its leg to allow the mouse to sleep.  The early rays of the sun passing through the crack in the den fell on the lion’s eyes and made it wake up. As it opened its eyes, it found the mouse sleeping innocently well on its leg. \nThe lion watched the mouse for sometime and later it woke up the mouse gently with its paw.  The mouse woke up and looked straight into the face of the lion that appeared so big as it was very close.  It cried loudly and tried to jump out but prevented gently by the lion.\nDo be frightened, you have slept on my leg and hence I woke you up: said the lion.  Looking straight into the eyes of the lion the mouse broke into peels of laughter.  Seeing mouse the lion too started laughing.\nTogether the lion and the mouse lived forever….\n ©2007 IVNS Raju"

    "title": "PERRY PARTRIDGE",
    "author": "Richard & Esther Provencher",
    "text": "After an early morning rain, the ground was like a wet sponge. \n“Hurry up,” Bushy-Red said, shaking his reddish head.\nHis fuzzy squirrel coat trembled in the wind.  Bushy-Red liked to cling upside down.  Sharp claws held tightly to a large maple tree. \nAs usual, he was impatient.  And his black nose wiggled nervously. \nHis best friend, Perry Partridge was being a slow poke.  They were supposed to go on a picnic, at least before the sun set.\nPerry was busy exercising his wings.  He kept trying to fly higher than the lowest branch. \n“Be patient,” he called to his squirrel-friend.  “I’m almost finished.”\nPerry was still a young Partridge.  And he had to keep in practice. \nOnce more he ran down the path created by years of animal usage.  His three-toed feet left deep marks in the soft soil.  Feathers flapped faster and faster. \nThis time he landed almost on top of Bushy-Red.\n“Yikes! Watch it!” the squirrel squealed.\n“Try running like Fred-Fox the next time.  And keep your head up,” HOOTY Owl chuckled.  She was another one of Perry’s good friends.\nThe little Partridge tried seven more times.  Thankfully, crash landing on the ground did not hurt.  And finally Perry was successful. \nNow three friends sat together on the conquered limb.  From here they could see most of Greenwoods, their homeland in a little valley. \n“Look at the tall woods on both sides,” Perry said.\n“I see them every day,” HOOTY added. \n“Yah, but I don’t,“ Bushy-Red scolded.  “I think this view is really neat.  So there.”\n“Now, now,” Perry interrupted.  He did not like his friends to argue.  And they usually did.\nPretty Pasture looked yellow under the noonday sun.  The high grass was a safe place for the Dee-Deer to sleep. \n “I can see a tiny lake,” Perry said.  He had never flown this high before.\n“That’s North Pond,” HOOTY quickly answered.\n“I was at South Pond once,” Busy-Red said.\nTheir branch swayed like a swing, back and forth, back and forth.\nJust then, two fat floppy crows flew by.  “Hello HOOTY!” they yelled.\n“HELLOOO,” HOOTY politely answered.\n“Cheers to you too, Bushy-Red,” they said.\nBushy-Red was puzzled.  “What does Cheers mean?” he asked HOOTY.\n“It means, Be Happy,” HOOTY answered.\n“Thanks,” Bushy-Red said.  “CHEERIES!” he shouted.  Somehow his word did not sound the same. \n“Bye-Bye, Perry.” By now the fat floppy crows were almost at Three-Trees.  It was a meeting place for everyone in Greenwoods. \n“Perry quickly put his wings to his beak.  “BYEEE-BYEEE!!” became an echo in the valley.\nIt was time for the three friends to begin their hike. \nPerry flew from branch to branch.  All those flying practices sure helped. \nBushy-Red scurried up and down trees along their path.  And he searched around each one for any of his buried treasures. \nHOOTY fluttered along carrying the food sack.  It was heavy and she had to rest often. \nFinally they stopped beside Creepy Creek.  It sang a song of strange noises as it winded like a corkscrew through the valley. \nPerry and Bushy-Red prepared the snacks.  It was only fair since HOOTY had carried the food all this way.\nThere was fresh leaf-tips and bush cranberries for Perry.  And a branch full of Hazel nuts for Bushy-Red. \nHOOTY was given his favourite treat, leftover pieces of mouse. \nAfter full tummies they rested. \n‘”Remember what happened yesterday?” Perry asked. \n“That Ra-Rabbit was sure lucky we came along,” HOOTY answered.\n“Yes,” said Bushy-Red.  “Something was wrapped around Ra-Rabbit’s front leg.” He and Perry did not know it was a circle of wire. \n“It came from the Village of Walking-Trees.  Beyond Greenwoods,” wise HOOTY added. \nPerry had never heard that name before. \nHOOTY continued with her story.  “Sounds of thunder and lightning come from their branches.  It happens during the time of autumn.  And sometimes Dee-Deer fall to the ground.  Then they go to Forever Place.”\nPerry wrapped his feathery arms around Bushy-Red.  The squirrel was sure shaking. \n“Please.  No more stories about those unwelcome visitors,” Perry said.  \nThey had a nice cold drink from Creepy Creek.  Then there was time to play.\nHOOTY hid first.  She found a low branch on a thick pine tree.  But they could not find her.  She had to call out, “Hoot! Hoot!” until they did. \nPerry Partridge decided to hide under a log pile.  But his friends could not find him either.  He finally had to beat one wing loudly against a fallen tree. \nOnly then did Perry’s friends find him. \nWhen they tired of their game they continued on their journey.  And kept a watchful eye for “HUSHY-Hawk.”\nIf that nasty bird caught HOOTY, he would eat her. \nThey also had to be watchful of C-C Coyote.  And W-Wolf.  They lived in the Dark Woods, way past North Pond.  Squirrel and partridge would provide a tasty meal, if they were captured.\nThree friends now went for a swim. \nThey jumped and flew together off huge Rough Rock.  It was like a diving board.  They shouted and splashed noisily. \nAnd shook wet feathers and fur at each other.\nAfter a short rest, they headed home.\nThis time they walked across Pretty Pasture.  And rushed past Lightning Tree.  “Long ago, a crooked arrow came from the sky, “ HOOTY said.  “It bent that tree and left it all dark on one side.”\nThey sang songs and laughed and yelled a lot.  Three friends hopped, skipped and flew.  This time Perry led the way. \nTheir happy sounds carried across the sky. \nHigh above ‘Eagle Eyes’ slowly flapped her Bald Eagle wings.  She wanted to make sure three friends returned home safely. \nGreenwoods soon turned dark. \nPerry and Bushy-Red went to their homes with sleepy eyes. \nAnd HOOTY flew off until tomorrow’s fun.\n* * *\n© Richard & Esther Provencher 2004 "

    "text": "Prince Spencer and Princess Maddie of the Kingdom of Space Land went to their father King Chris and their mom Queen Nannie at the SpaceLandCastle.\nThey told their father the King Chris and their mom Queen Nannie that they wanted a doggie. Not just any of kind of dog but they wanted a Little Brown Barking Dog.\nTheir father the King was a good father and Queen Nannie was a very good mommy. They were pleased that the Prince and Princess wanted to get a Little Brown Barking Dog. The King told the Prince and Princess that they could get a Little Brown Barking Dog.\nThe King sent for his King’s Dog keeper and told him to go into the town to find a Little Brown Barking Dog and bring it back to the palace for Princess Maddie and Prince Spencer.\nThe King’s Dog keeper was a nice man named Mr. Happy. He was always as happy as his name said.\n“I will find the best Little Brown Barking Dog in the Kingdom of Space Land and bring it here to live with the Prince and Princess at the castle.\nThe King told his Dog keeper Mr. Happy to take along Prince Spencer and Princess Maddie to find a Little Brown Barking Dog for the castle.\nOff they went into the town. They went to the Space Land Pet Store. The King’s Dog keeper Mr. Happy followed by the Prince and Princess went into the Space Land Pet Store. They went up to the Space Land Pet Store owner and the King’s Dog keeper Mr. Happy spoke with the Space Land Pet Store owner. “My good fellow I am here to get a Little Brown Barking Dog for the Prince and the Princess.”\n“Umm…I do not have a Little Brown Barking Dog but I do have a Large Green Croaking Frog.”\nThe King’s Dog keeper spoke, “No thank you sir. The Prince and Princess do not want a Large Green Croaking Frog but they want a Little Brown Barking Dog. Can you tell us where to get a Little Brown Barking Dog?.”\nThe Pet Shop owner said, “I do not know where to get a Little Brown Barking Dog. You may find a Little Brown Barking Dog at the King’s Royal Doggie Park. They have a lot of Barking Dogs there”.\nOff they went to the King’s Royal Doggie Park to find a Little Brown Barking Dog.\nAt the King’s Royal Doggie Park there were many dogs jumping and running. The dogs were having fun. The King’s Royal Dog keeper Mr. Happy looked around and he spotted a Little Brown Barking Dog. The Little Brown Barking Dog was running and jumping and playing in the King’s Royal Doggie Park. The King’s Royal Dog keeper Mr. Happy asked the woman owner of this Little Brown Barking Dog if she would give the dog to the Prince and Princess to take to the castle. The woman said she would love to give the dog to the Prince and Princess. But she told Mr. Happy that she had the Little Brown Barking Dog since it was a puppy. The woman would be very sad to give her Little Brown Barking Dog away. She told them” I know of a place where there were many dogs. The place was the Royal Doggie Shop”. She told them that the dogs were there for anyone to take.\n“All that you need is a nice owner and a nice place for the dog to live and they will give you a nice doggie.” She said.\n“I know you are right. We will go to the Royal Doggie Shop and get a Little Brown Barking Dog” The King’s Royal Dog keeper Mr. Happy told her. He thanked the woman for her help.\n“We shall go there now.” He said.\nOff Mr. Happy, The Prince Spencer and Princess Maddie went to the Royal Doggie Shop.\nThey went to the Royal Doggie Shop quickly. It was very near the King’s Royal Doggie Park.\nThey went into the Royal Doggie Shop. Mr. Happy, Prince Spencer and Princess Madison were very happy to find it was full of dogs. There were big dogs, small dogs, black and white dogs, white and black dogs, there were tall skinny dogs, and little short dogs. There were jumpy dogs and there were sleepy dogs resting in their beds. Prince Spencer and Princess Maddie had never seen so many dogs in one place.\nAt first they did not find a Little Brown Barking Dog so they asked the King’s Royal Doggie Shop Man about it. “Sir, do you have a Little Brown Barking Dog that we could take to the castle to live with us?” asked the children.\n“Why yes I do have such a Little Brown Barking Dog. If you like her then you can take her back to the King’s castle with you. This Little Brown Barking Dog is very special. He does two tricks. One trick he can do is he can carry a ball in his mouth and walk around with it. The other trick he does is that he goes to the door each day is to get the mail at the door from the Postman and bring it to me. He gets the mail from the Postman’s hand and brings it to me from the door. This Little Brown Barking Dog is very smart because you cannot teach a dog to get the mail from the Postman. It is a very special trick that only he can do. The Little Brown Barking Dog will be happy at the castle living with you.” The Royal Doggie Shop Man then put the Little Brown Barking Dog in a doggie box and handed it to the King’s Royal Dogkeeper to carry back to the castle.\nOff went Prince Spence, Princess Maddie, and Mr. Happy back to the Royal Castle to show King Chris and Queen Nannie the Little Brown Barking Dog they had found. They knew their family would be pleased to get a dog who could do two special tricks.\nThey set the doggie box in front of King Chris and opened the top. The Little Brown Barking Dog and he naturally started running and barking.\nThe King Chris laughed loudly and exclaimed, “I declare today Little Brown Barking Dog day in the Space Land Kingdom. I want everyone to have a great day.” The Little Brown Barking Dog then ran toward the Castle door to await the Postman bringing in the daily mail.\nThe Prince and Princess invited all the children in the Space Land Kingdom to come to the castle to see their Little Brown Barking Dog.\nQueen Nannie decorated the castle very special for the party and welcomed the children when they came to the party.\nPrincess Maddie wanted to name the Little Brown Barking Dog. Prince Spencer asked the Court Jester — Royal Nave named Brandon of Burgoyne what a good name for the Little Brown Barking Dog should be. Nave Brandon of Burgoyne thought for a moment and said, “I once had a fine hunting dog named GiGi the Fine dog. I don’t think you should give her the exact same name so let’s just call her Gigi the Little Brown Barking Dog.” The children laughed and agreed. They both said together, “Yes, it’s a good name and we will call it– GigiThe Little Brown Barking Dog.”\nAt this point the many children at the party gathered around Prince Spencer, Princess Maddie, King Chris, Queen Nannie, Mr. Happy and his wife Mrs. Honey, and Court Jester Nave Andrew and they all sang a little song to Riles The Little Brown Barking Dog:\n(CHILDREN SINGING)\n“I wanted a Little Brown Barking Dog so I went to the Pet Store and\nI asked the Pet Store Man—do you have a Little Brown Barking Dog.\nNo, he said—I don’t have a Little Brown Barking Dog; but I have a Green\nCroaking Frog.\nI told him that I didn’t want a Green Croaking Frog but I wanted a Little Brown Barking Dog;\nI went to the The Doggie Park and found a woman with a Little Brown Barking Dog;\nI asked her if she would give me the Little Brown Barking Dog; She said no that she had to keep her Little Brown Barking Dog;\nI went to the man at the Doggie Shop and asked the man: Do you have\nA Little Brown Barking Dog?;\nHe said “Yes I have a Little Brown Barking Dog and he has two tricks.”\nHe said “You can have her to keep and he will do two tricks.”\nI am so happy now that I have a Little Brown Barking Dog and not a Green Croaking Frog.”\nEND\n©2008 Howard “Happy” Dunbar"

    "title": "GILMORE A GOLDFISH WHO DIDN’T WANT TO PLAY WITH TWIN BEARS",
    "author": "Jay Delms",
    "text": "I see my new home in the woods, Gilmore thought. Excited, he pressed his goldfish-face against the clear, plastic water bag the pet salesman had put him in.\nHis new owners, a bear family, were driving him home. Their rusty blue car bumped down the country road toward a log cottage.  Among the trees, it came into full view. It had red and yellow tulips near its front door. The green lawn glimmered. I see it! he thought.\nHolding the water bag up high, Mama Bear said, “Pull up next to the house, Papa. I’ll rush this fish to its tank before the cubs see it.” Quickly, Mama Bear went to the living room, and emptied the bag into the box-like tank. Papa Bear parked the car.\nWow! This tank’s huge, Gilmore thought. I’ve got rocks to hide behind, too.          \n“Feeding time,” Mama Bear said. She sprinkled dry fish food on top of the water. Papa Bear settled into his big easy chair with a newspaper in his paws.\n“Where are the twins?” he asked.\nUh Oh!  Gilmore wondered. Twin kids?\n“They’re playing in the backwoods,” she replied.\n“Hope they stay out of trouble,” he said.\n“Me, too,” she said. “I hope they treat this new fish better than the last one.”\nOh no!  Gilmore thought. I’m in trouble.\n“I hear them coming now,” Mama said.\n“Hi, Ma and Pa,” Nellie quipped as they came in.\n“What’s up?” Eddy asked.\n“Feeding our new fish,” Mama replied. “Its name is Gilmore.”\n“A goldfish!  Look, Nell, it’s big.”\n“Pretty too,” Nell said.\nAm I a girl now? Gilmore thought.\nNellie stuck her arm down into the water. “Here, fishy.” Suddenly, her elbow slipped from the edge of the tank. “Oh dear!” she exclaimed. “I almost tipped it over.”\nOh my!  Gilmore thought. That one’s clumsy as a whale in a bathtub!\n“Be careful! Nellie,” Mama scolded. “You cubs go take a bath before supper. I’ll start your water.”\n“Okay, Ma,” Eddy mumbled. “Don’t forget the sudsy soap.”\n“Once a week is too often,” Nellie whispered to Eddy as they slowly moved toward the bathroom.\n“That’s for sure,” she said. Gilmore watched them disappear into the hallway.\n“Okay, Guys, your bath and soap are ready,” Mama said.\n“Thanks, Ma,” Nellie said.\n“You cubs behave. No water on the floor, you hear?” Then, Mama Bear went outside to tend the flowers. The screen door slammed shut behind her.\n“Let’s get started,” Eddy groaned as they entered the bathroom.\n “Eddy, let’s add more soap,” Nellie suggested.\n“You know what, Nell?  Let’s get Gilmore, too.”\n“Good idea,” she said. “I’ll grab our play bucket.” They snuck into the living room. Nellie dropped the bucket into the tank where it landed on its side.\nWhat are these guys doing? Gilmore wondered. I’d better hide, fast.\n“Got him,” Nellie yelped. “He hid in the bucket I dropped next to a rock.”\nOh no!  Where are they taking me? Nellie poured Gilmore into the tub with her. \n“Turn on the water, Nell,” Eddy said. “Make it deeper for Gilmore.”\nThis is crazy, Gilmore thought. I can’t breathe in this bubbly mess.\n“Ma’s not going to like this,” Eddie said.\n“Aw, come on,” Nell said. “Watch me splash both my feet.”\n“Maybe you shouldn’t, Nell!”\nOh!  Gilmore moaned.  This soap is thick.  I must get myself out of here.\nI’ll leap into the air.\nFrantically, he swam to the bottom of the tub, and then darted upward with all of this strength.\n“Nell, stop it! I saw Gilmore jump from the tub?”\n“Where?” she asked.  “Oh no! He’s lying in a puddle next to the tub.”\nI can breath a little with one gill, Gilmore thought, relieved.  Maybe they’ll help me now?\n“Is he dead, Nell? “\nI feel sleepy, Gilmore thought.\nEddy and Nell bent down over Gilmore.\n“I don’t like this, Eddy.”\n“Me neither. Let’s rush him back to his tank.”\nGroan. It’s working. Hurry!\n“We’re sorry, Gilmore. Hurry Nell.”\n“He’s in,” Nell said. Teary eyed, they watched Gilmore sink motionlessly to the bottom of the tank.  Small air bubbles rose from his gills.\n“What’s going on here?” Mama Bear blurted, coming through the doorway. “Why’s the floor wet?  Hey!  Why is Gilmore on the bottom of the tank?”\n“We just learned something, Ma,” Nell said.\n“Yeah, what’s that?” Mama demanded.\n“Gilmore is already clean!” she replied.\nGood thought, Guys!  No more baths, please.  Gilmore took a deep breath.\n©2008  Jay Delms"

    "text": "“When is he coming?” Joseph mumbled, looking down the trail for the third time. It was difficult being patient, especially when his legs itched to move forward.\nThe boy always seemed to be waiting around for someone. Like dad who left last year, whose letters were rare as gold on the kitchen table. Finally, a familiar red cap and jacket came into view. Wire-rimmed glasses framed a smile.\n“Getting impatient?” his neighbor, Mr. Lawrence asked.\n“Yeah, well…no,” Joseph stammered. They had become good friends this past summer, even going fishing a few times. Today they were hunting partridge, something he never did before.\n“OK, time for a rest.”\nWe just began, the boy thought. “I’m not tired. Let’s go…”\n“Joseph, sit. Hunting isn’t just rushing around. It’s observing things.”\nToday’s trip might not be so cool after all. He listened to poplar leaves jiggling in the wind. Gold, orange and reddish-tinged leafy trees surrounded them. It was indeed a beautiful autumn sight. Maybe there was something in sitting and enjoying the view.\nBack in Truro Joseph was so busy with activities he barely had time to do his homework. “What kind of tree has such beautiful colors?” he asked.   \nThe man answered. “They’re sugar maples. Lots of them here, eh?”\n“What about that one?”\n“I think it’s a red pine.”\n“Is that a scotch pine to the right?” the boy asked.\n“Yes. How did you know that?”\n“My father used to work for Lands and Forests. He taught me a lot.”\n“Trying to test me, eh?” Mr. Lawrence asked, jumping to his feet. “Ready? Or do you need some more rest?”\n“One more question?” Joseph asked.\n“Yes?”\n“You stopped so we could look around. Right?”\n“And take time to smell the roses!” they piped in together.\n“Now I’m ready,” the boy said, feeling more relaxed. They walked quietly for the next hour, listening for the unmistakable sound of a partridge.\nMr. Lawrence cradled his .410 shotgun in the crook of his arm.\n“A rabbit!” Joseph shouted. “Look!” At the sound of his voice, the small animal disappeared into the underbrush. “How come you didn’t try and shoot it?” the boy asked.\n“It’s not rabbit season.”\n“Yeah, but who would know?”\n“We would.”\nJoseph mumbled under his breath. “I thought we came here to shoot something,” he said.\n“Did you notice the colors on the rabbit?”\n“Yeah, brown with splashes of white all over.”\n“Good observation,” Mr. Lawrence said. “White will be his camouflage when winter comes.”\n“Cool.”\n“Very observant, Joseph. The rabbit was really charging away. I didn’t think you’d see the white on his feet.”\nThis made Joseph feel special. He wasn’t used to an adult saying nice things to him.Mom did, but moms have to, he thought. Since dad took off it was left for mom to be his cheerleader.\n“When are we going to see some partridge? Besides, I’m getting hungry,” Joseph, asked.\n“Which do you want to do first?”\n“Eat!”\n“Spoken like a true hunter,” said Mr. Lawrence.\nThey ate delicious Cream of Broccoli soup from their thermos container. Mr. Lawrence brought the dessert, cookies and granola bars.\n“Mom makes great soup,” Joseph boasted.\n“You really love your mom, don’t you?\nJoseph’s answer was a radiant smile.\nDo you want to try some target shots later?”\n“May I?” the boy exclaimed almost spilling his soup. “Wow. Really?”\nAfter eating both tidied up, then Mr. Lawrence set up a wood target around ten inches square. The background was a sandy hill.\n“No danger this way from shotgun pellets flying across the trail,” Mr. Lawrence advised. “Always practice safety in the woods, young man.”\nUnder the watchful guidance of Mr. Lawrence, the boy prepared himself. As the shotgun boomed, pellets slammed into the target.\n“Nice shot!”\n“I did it!”\n“Does your shoulder hurt?”\n“No. I did just as you told me. Hold the gun stock tightly against my muscle.”\n“Good thing you have those muscles,” Mr. Lawrence teased.\nHanding the empty shotgun back, the boy said, “Thanks for trusting me.” Not far down the trail, a young doe stood watching.\n“OHHH!” Joseph gasped.\nThe noise startled the wild animal. It turned quickly and leaped into the woods. Its white tail bobbed like a flag, as it headed for new adventures.\n“Did I scare it?” Joseph asked.\n“No.”\n“How come?”\n“Nature teaches it to be careful around humans.”\n“Why?”\n“Because we might be hunting her.”\n“But it’s not deer season,” Joseph said.\n“Except the deer isn’t quite sure,” the man said. “How come you wanted me to shoot the rabbit?”\n“Well, I’m learning each animal has a special season.” The boy thought for a moment. “Mr. Lawrence, how come we kill things?”\n“I hunt to eat the game. And I also follow all the rules. Besides its a chance for me to get some exercise.”\nThe boy nodded.\n“I also get to spend some time with you,” Mr. Lawrence added. And poked the boy on the shoulder.\nJoseph remembered when it used to be like this with dad. The two of them doing things together. It felt good to have someone caring about him again. The rest of the day was a challenge. It rained tiny pellets of hail and drove the man and boy into shelter under the trees.\nWhite birch gleamed like smiling teeth. After the rainfall they walked more trails, boots scuffing rocky sections.\n“These bits of gravel are picked up by partridge early morning and evening,” the man explained.\n“Why?” the boy asked.\n“It goes into a crop, like a packsack under their throat. It helps grind down leaves and seed that are picked up from the ground.”\n“Neat,” the boy answered.\nSuddenly they heard a pounding sound. As if a small child was banging, quicker than a drummer. The noise rose eerily through the trees, like a musical pattern reaching a high pitch that thrilled their ears.\n“It’s beautiful,” Joseph breathed. “What animal causes those sounds?”\n“A male partridge calling for a mate. Right now he’s standing close by on an old log and flapping rapidly at the air with his wings. It’s the message of life, Joseph. That’s how you and I came into this world.”\n“Yeah…I know,” the boy answered. “Mom talked to me about all that stuff a long time ago.”\nThe man smiled and said, “I’m glad.”\nTheir return on the trail was without conversation. Each had much to think about. They had shared the trail; conversation, food and Joseph even fired a shotgun for the first time.\nWhen they finally reached their car, the boy paused then stretched as he looked around. He watched billowy clouds pile like pillows over the trees. The sun’s warmth covered his face.\nThe man was pleased. It had been a good day. His legs had additional energy for walking but it was the right time to go home.\n“Mr. Lawrence, I had an awesome time. I don’t care if we didn’t shoot anything.”\nYes, the man thought, it was a good hunting trip.\n“How about taking me again?” Joseph asked.\n* * *\n© Richard & Esther Provencher 2007"

    "title": "CALLING OF THE LOONS",
    "author": "Richard & Esther Provencher",
    "text": "Morning’s stillness was broken by the strange, laughing call of a loon. Colin punched his granddad on the shoulder, their two-man tent getting warm from an early burst of sun.\n“Time to get up,” Colin whispered. “Listen. Listen.”\nHis granddad quickly dressed and joined his grandson outside. He passed his binoculars to Colin. The boy was nervous as he focused on his target.\nThe dark outline of a loon showed bright and clear, its head and neck blackish with narrow patches of white on its throat. Granddad said loons were usually in pairs. And they picked out their own special lake to raise a family.\nIt was not pleasant at home and Granddad felt a little camping weekend would be good for Colin. The boy’s eyes blurred as he looked through the binoculars. If only his parents were here to see this.\n“Look Colin. They’re diving for some small fish for breakfast.”\nColin learned they could stay underwater a long time and then surface much further away. He returned the binoculars to his granddad.\n“How about some breakfast?” granddad asked.\nColin’s thoughts were mixed as he watched granddad work on their campfire.\n“Okay, I guess,” he answered sadly. He helped a little, then a lot — and the dark cloud finally left his thoughts. “Granddad, do loons ever fight?” he asked.\n“I’m not sure. If they don’t, it’s because they realize there is so much space to share.”\nColin wished humans could be like that.\n“It’s not possible for a perfect world,” Granddad’s voice interrupted.\n“Well it’s not fair. We should be working together just like the loons!” Colin shouted.\nHe remembered his granddad telling him loons usually produce two eggs. Also when they traveled on the water each parent looked after one of the young loons—to protect and care for them.\nAfter breakfast, the boy and his granddad prepared for a canoe trip. They carried, then placed the craft in two feet of water and got in. Colin’s paddle thumped loudly on the thwart.\n“Did I scare away the loons, Granddad?”\n“Not really, Colin. They’re resting somewhere right now. We’ll see them again tonight.”\nThe day passed swiftly as they paddled and fished from one inlet to another. During that time, they spotted chipmunks, a porcupine, deer and many varieties of birds. The chickadee was Colin’s favorite, and Its piping call seemed to say – “This is my land!”\nCatching two nice sized fish meant a delicious supper of lake trout and beans. “I want tonight to be just perfect,” granddad said. “Good food and good camping with my grandson.”\n“With lots of love,” Colin added. “And no fighting,” his lips whispered. Colin thought about his mother and father. If only he could give them a hug right now.\nMaybe he should say the things he felt inside — about how kind Granddad is and how the loons send a thrill up and down his back. Maybe he should do a little more at home, like drying the dishes. Or even help Dad with the firewood.\nWhen Dad got grouchy, Colin would now try not to growl back. Or slam his bedroom door when he was upset. He wanted everyone to give each other another chance. They should be like the loons. They could work it out.\n“Colin?”\n“Yes?”\n“Almost time.”\n“Okay.”\nThey tidied up the campsite for their last evening in the woods. Then they dressed in warm clothes, put mosquito repellant on and walked quietly to the edge of the lake.\nAs they sat together on a log, Colin leaned against Granddad’s shoulder. The older man’s arm circled his precious grandson. Then a trickle of sound crept across the water. The wind’s breath gathered in a growing symphony and carried it to the man and boy waiting eagerly.\nThey were not disappointed. Loons called one to another in playful chords, sensing they had a captive audience. Sounds of peace, and melodic beauty crisscrossed the lake.\nAnd they were absorbed into a little boy’s heart. His own song was one of love for his family. Like the loons, he would bring back a message of a family working together.\nColin placed his arm around his granddad’s shoulder. He squeezed really hard.\n* * *\n© Richard & Esther Provencher 2007"

    "title": "Gimpy the Mother Bear and Her Four Babies Go Camping",
    "author": "Sindy Leah Cashman",
    "text": "Once upon a time there were four babies and Gimpy they decided to go camping at the same campsite as we did.  My name is Sara and I went camping with my Mom and my older sister Jessica and my younger brother Connor and my baby sister Willow.  We had set up our tents at Hickory Run State Park site 93 camping is so much fun we go every summer, but this year was the most exciting.\nMom and the four of us were having a great time camping we spent the day at the beach building sand castles with moats.  Then when we got hot we splashed into the water and chased the schools of fish shimmering in the cool lake water and if you got lucky you could even see a tadpole, I love it when they are starting to grow there legs they look so neat I haven’t caught one yet they are really super fast I keep trying though.\nConnor and Willow are little so they have to wear Swimmies and use floats sometimes. Mom even pushes them around on our big fish raft our Uncle gave to us at least until my big sister Jessica takes it to lay on in the water she’s a teenager she’s really long and angry. Sometimes she plays with us but usually she just has that mean angry face, oh well Mom makes her play with us anyway.\nWhen we went back to the campsite we were so hungry.  Mom made a fire she is amazing she built the fire and we helped wrap dinner in tin foil so we could cook it on the grill over the fire.  Mom puts it on the fire we aren’t allowed because fire is dangerous and we could get hurt so while she is cooking we are in the tent with the big lantern coloring pictures we show to her through the tent wall they are see through.  After dinner we made smores we get to roast marshmallows and make them with graham crackers and chocolate bars, which is my favorite part of camping.\nWe all helped Mom and Jessica put the food in the car we even picked up the marshmallows on the ground they were sticky and covered in dirt and pine needles gross.  Mom said if we don’t the bears will come to our campsite to eat  and marshmallows aren’t good for animals they should eat berries and things that are in the woods and absolutely no food in the tents bears have great sniffers and would smell anything in our pockets and everyone knows bears are very hungry.\nWillow and Connor get tired fast so we sang some songs and got ready for bed.  I could stay up all night but we all have to go in our tents to get the babies to sleep, except Jessica she gets to stay up and watch the fire she says it’s the best part of her day.\nAs we lie in our tents you can see the flickering colors of light bouncing off the tent you can even see shadows.  Then the babies went to sleep so Mom put on the flashlight so I could make shadow puppets.  I can make a dog and a butterfly. I was starting to go to sleep so we turned off the flashlight and snuggled under the blankets I remember watching shadows moving outside our tent  probably just Jessica walking around so I went to sleep.\nNext thing I hear Jessica is yelling Bear! Bear! Bear! Mom told her to stay away from it and she left the tent we stayed inside.  They were shining the flashlight on the bear who was trying to get into our car we forgot to close the windows and bears have good sniffers.  The bear was taller than the car we could see the bears long nose and little ears.  Mom had read in a pamphlet the park ranger gave us to yell at the bear to scare it away, they were yelling but the bear just looked at them.  Then they saw another bear on the other side of the car.  Now we were getting scared the marshmallows were in there if they eat them no more smores.\nJessica and Mom started yelling for help the bears weren’t leaving and now there were more of them.  They are so cute though, they were so black and shiny they look just like teddy bears it was sad to see them getting yelled at.  I know Mom was just trying to scare them so they would leave not knowing if they were angry bears or not.  Hard to believe that Jessica couldn’t scare them she yells all the time.  After a few more minutes the bears started moving off the car I don’t know if they were scared they didn’t look scared I think they just didn’t want to be where it was so noisy.  As the big bear lumbered away she was limping and she had four little bears following her.  There were five bears they all walked across the road and climbed up a hill into the woods.\nA Park Ranger pulled up in his truck just as the five bears went into the woods.  He asked if everyone was Okay, we were.  He asked us if one of the bears were walking funny, we said yes.  Then he told us that we had met Gimpy she was a mother bear she had four babies two she had just had this year one from last year and she had adopted a bear cub.  So there were five bears he said they were going home they go down to the ravine below our campsite and follow the stream home.  They probably wanted a snack before going to bed she is very nice and never gives anyone any problems but there is a snooty bear on loop C that is another camping area I’m glad we didn’t meet snooty bear.\nThe Ranger said he would keep an eye on them and we would be safe so we could go back to sleep.  Remember he said all wildlife needs to be respected always use caution around animals and give them plenty of space.  They can get scared too.  So we went to sleep and the next morning we had to pack up and go home I really hope to see Gimpy again with her four babies her family is just as big as ours.  I didn’t mind sharing the campsite with Gimpy but next time we will remember to close our car windows.\nThe End\nGood Night Little Ones\n©2007 Sindy Leah Cashman "

    "text": "You are aware that during winter the trees shed leaves and make the birds and other small animals that live on them to face cold nights.\nOne cold night a squirrel found it difficult to bear the cold.  It was on a search for a place that can protect it from the cold.  It ran into the parasol of a hut that belongs to an old man who lives on the outskirts of the forest.\nAs soon as the squirrel started moving in the parasol of his hut the old man heard the sound of it, came out and found the squirrel shivering with cold.  He extended his hand and waved his fingers to come on to it.  The squirrel for a moment kept quite and it recalled what all it had seen this old man doing earlier.  It appeared from this recalling that this old man is a good one.  It slowly crawled onto the hand of the old man who caressed it with his another hand and took it in side.\nIt was very warmth inside the hurt and it made the squirrel stop shivering soon and fall asleep.  It slept for more than three hours and woke up with the sound of the cupboard door opened by the old man.  The old man noticed this and came near the squirrel with a hot cup of tomato soup.  He fed the squirrel with the spoon and emptied the cup. \nThe squirrel became active and found the holes in the roof of the hut.  The old man slept again.  As the day breaks out, the old man woke up and found searched for the squirrel in vain.  He thought that it had gone back to the forest.  He became busy with his daily chores. \nAs he was about to rest for a nap after the lunch, he heard a noise on the top of the roof.  He looked up and found that the holes on the roof are being filled with a lump of fiber.  He went out to find out who was at work and saw the squirrel seriously filling the holes one after the other first with the fiber and topping it with a big leaf meticulously.\nThe old man came inside and started doing some thing.  The squirrel on the top of the roof completed its job and entered the hut to find out if it missed any hole.  The old man thanked the squirrel and offered a cup of hot milk.  The squirrel drank it merrily.\nThe old man asked, ‘how did get the fiber and the leaves to fill all the holes at once?’\nI came out in the morning when you were still sleeping, started collecting the fiber and leaves from the nearby creeper in small quantities and brought them to the rooftop.  Once I felt I had enough material to fill the holes I started doing the job that I know well.\nThough you are a small animal you have a big mind to think and great strength to do the job.  I thank you for your kind help.  You can live with me, if you want – said the old man.\nThe squirrel agreed to it by waving its tail and the head in joy.\nIndeed the holes were well filled and the rainfall that occurred a couple of days later made it further firm and there was no leakage in the hut.\nThey lived together for a long time in the same hut.\n ©2007 IVNS Raju"

    "title": "A Winter Night in the Forest",
    "author": "Raju",
    "text": "It was a winter night and the cool breeze is making animals seek some shelter and a cover on their bodies. The sparrows entered their nests, the rabbits went into their burrows, the parrots went into the holes on the tree trunks, the squirrels hide into the shoots of the coconut tree. Thus all those birds and animals settled down to face the chill night. Dr.Dove was watching all these animals in the bright moon light from its whole on the nearby rocky hill.\nBy mid night the chillness increased and a couple of crows had fallen seriously ill for the exposure to the severe cold.\nAs the Sun rises all the animals and birds started coming out and assembled at the bottom of the rocky hill.\nWhat a cold it was last night. The winter has just begun now. By January it would be very cold. If the cold winds blow like this we will certainly reduce in number – said a crane that lives on the nearby thorn bushes.\nI could hear the sound of my teeth as I shivered in the night – said a dog.\nThough we are big we too feel the cold said an elephant.\nThough I am in my Den I too felt it.\nHere comes an idea – said Dr. .Dove by landing on a big stone.\nWe all know that the Lion lives in a big den in this hill. I have seen another small den that can comfortable accommodate our Lion. It is just on the other side of this Hill. I feel that the Lion can leave this big den and occupy the small one so that those animals that have no home can take shelter in the big den. Thus they can protect themselves from exposing to the severe cold.\nAs soon as Dr. Dove completed telling this, the lion roared and rejected the idea. I need this big den let animals seek shelter in the small den that you had located.\nLooking at the elephants Dr .Dove said – Dear Lion this is only for the winter months and rainy days the rest of the time you can use this big den. The elephants trumpeted in support of this statement and urged the lion to agree.\nSeeing the unity and the support Dr. Dove got from the herd of Elephants the Lion said : OK I agree.\nThe animals disbursed in search of food.\nIt was night again. All those animals that have no home gathered in the big den and felt good to be there. As the night advances the cold winds blew more frequently and making the animals shiver even in the Den. Some how they spent the night and gathered again at the bottom of the hill to share their experiences.\nSince the den is not so deep it can protect us partially from the severe cold. We have to live with it – opined the deer.\nHaving listened to this discussion, Dr. Dove said: I have another idea to help you keep warm. You all can collect the twigs and our elephant friends can bring dried logs in the forest to the den. As mid night one of you can make these twigs and dried logs into a small heap and set fire. Then the den gets the warmth from this fire.\nGreat idea jumped a monkey.\nThat night the animals make their own hearth and felt the warmth and slept comfortably.\nThe animals make it a practice.\n©2007 IVNS Raju"

    "text": "Jeremiah’s feet landed in the middle of the murky waters of his Mississippi mud hole. Splash-splash and ‘slop—slop, slurp,’ went the water and mud as it lapped over his white sneakers. His mom’s voice echoed briefly, “Don’t get those new sneakers dirty, or I’ll hit the roof Jeremiah.” He scooted his feet to the left, then to the right, getting the most splatter effect possible from twisting his sneakers. It sure was fun outside after a rain; there were mud puddles, crawly worms, and even the air smelled wet. Mississippi must be the best place to live in the whole world!\nJeremiah smiled and looked down at his sneakers; Mom’s voice was more clear, “Don’t get those new sneakers dirty, or I’ll hit the roof Jeremiah.” Cold sweat beaded across Jeremiah’s forehead and the back of his neck prickled with guilt. His stomach leaped up his throat and tried to jump from his mouth. He clasped his hand over his lips just in time. Mom said she ‘would hit the roof’ if he ruined another pair of shoes. Mom never broke a promise; and he was afraid if she saw his shoes, she would hurt herself when she ‘hit the roof’. It was up to him to keep his mom from being hurt.\nJeremiah was eight, but he recalled Mr. Ben his second-grand teacher saying that he was a smart intellect. Think—he had to come up with a plan. The answer came as easy as slipping a brownie from Aunt Kim’s bakery when she wasn’t looking. He knew what to do.\nHe scampered to the rear of the house and sat down on the steps leading to the garden. He tugged off his shoes, wiped the mud from them onto his face and shirt, and then tousled his hair for ‘effect’. He threw his shoes in the garden’s compost pile and dashed back to the front of the house. Sadie, his golden retriever, thought he was playing with her as he passed; but he ignored her.\n“Mom, oh mom…help please…,” he wailed loudly.\nJeremiah’s mom came to the front door, “Jeremiah, what’s wrong, where are you?” She pushed the door open looking toward the front yard.\nHe stumbled in front of her, moaning, and collapsed to the ground, “Mommy…I’m here,” he said more faint this time.\n“For gracious sakes, what has happened to you and where are your shoes?”\n“It was awful, Mommeeeee, just awful.\nA great big dragon jumped out from behind the tree and landed on me. I swear I didn’t do a thing to him; he just came at me. He tried to eat me, but I kicked and kicked so the only part he ate was my sneakers. Oh, Mommy, I’m so sorry he ate my new shoes!”\nMom looked a bit puzzled said, “If a dragon ate your shoes, where is he?”\nJeremiah knew what his Mom was trying to do, but he was still in control, “After the dragon ate my shoes, he laid down across the sidewalk. Then, this great big giraffe came running clumsily down the same sidewalk, scooped up the dragon and swallowed him whole.\nWhat could I do? There’s no way I was putting my hand down a giraffe’s throat, my arms are too short!”\nSadie darted to the front porch and then circled Jeremiah. She dropped something at his feet then tackled him to the ground. Mom reached down and picked up Sadie’s gift of a white sneaker covered in mud and compost.\n“Well, what do you know?” Mom said, handing the sneaker to him.\n“Well, Mom….Sadie is a ‘real’ retriever I suppose. She braved the dragon and giraffe to ‘retrieve’ my shoes,” he said pursing his lips and wrinkling his nose. Sadie was too good a retriever.\n"

    "text": "Once upon a time, in a place far away there lived a donkey. He didn’t look very smart but he was smart. He used to eat grass all the time. He had no owner at all. One day a man called James came. Then the donkey jumped into the bushes and made no sound at all. The donkey stared at James. When James was gone, the donkey still stayed in the bushes for 2 minutes because he knew that the man was going to come back. James came back with his son Tom, to have a walk with him. When James and Tom were gone, the donkey saw the house. But he still kept eating the grass. When the donkey was full, he went near the house. James wife, Orla, got scared; she never saw a donkey before. No one saw a donkey before. But that donkey had seen lots of people before. The donkey made a donkey sound, and then Orla closed the door because she thought that the donkey was angry. Orla took a bucket and went to the well, from the back door. The donkey waited near the house until she was back. She took a little while to come back. When Orla came back she had the bucket full of water. She opened the front door and put the bucket near the donkey. The donkey started drinking the water. When the bucket of water was over he went back wagging his tail. Orla said to James and Tom that “Today when you went out for a walk. I saw a funny looking thing that made a funny sound and I went to the well with a bucket and took some water and gave it to the funny looking thing and he went back.” Then Tom said “Mom, maybe it was an alien!” Orla and James said “But everyone knows that there are no aliens.” That time the donkey ran back to their house. Then Tom shouted “IS THAT IT MOM!” Then Orla looked out of the window and said “YES!” Then she asked, “How about we make that thing as a pet?” Then James and Tom said “Yes!” Then Tom ran over to open door. Then Tom said “Mom, do we have some biscuits?” Orla said “Yes, we do, you can feed it to the funny thing.” Then Orla gave five biscuits to Tom. Then the donkey made a donkey sound. Tom started laughing and said “Mom, it makes a funny sound. Doesn’t it?” Orla said “Yes, it does.” Then James said “I think we should give him some name.” Tom shouted “YES!” Orla asked Tom “So what’s the name” Tom says the name is …… hmm this is hard to think. Maybe…JAKE!” James said “Good idea!” And they all lived happily ever after with their Jake.\nThe End\n© 2013 PARI BHAMRE"

    "title": "Morris the Monkey",
    "author": "Karen Cossey",
    "text": "Morris the little monkey woke up when the sun was high up in the sky. Another lovely day. Perfect for playing hide and sneak. Off he went to find his friends.\nFirst he came across Henry the hippopotamus. “Let’s play hide and sneak!” he called out from the top of a tree. “Not today Morris,” boomed Henry. “There’s only three more days till the big fishing competition. I’ve got to clean my boat and check for leaks. You should be doing the same, don’t you think?” “Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow.”\nJust then, who should come along but Lucas the lion. “There’s no way you’d get me anywhere near the water, even in a boat,” he shivered. “Come on Morris, I’ll play.”\nSo they played hide and sneak until the sun went down. The next day was sunny again, perfect for racing games. Morris came across Rose the rhino first. “Let’s race Rose,” he chattered excitedly. “Not today thanks Morris. It’s only two more days until the big fishing competition. I have to fix my motor and get my gear together. I don’t want to forget anything! Shouldn’t you be getting ready?” “Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow. Today’s a great day for racing. I’ll go find Lucas.”\nLucas the lion was nearby, lounging in the sun. He loved racing games too, so they played until dinnertime. Morris woke up next morning to another hot day. Perfect for sliding down Big Hill on banana leaves. Off he went to find Zach the zebra. He loved sliding down Big Hill. “No, not today,” said Zach when Morris found him. “Only one day until the big fishing competition. I have to untangle my lines and mend my net. Shouldn’t you be getting ready?” “Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow, before the competition starts. It’s the best day today for sliding down Big Hill.”\nAs he was leaving he came across Lucas again. They spent the rest of the day sliding down Big Hill. What a blast! The day sped by all too quickly and it was a very tired Morris who climbed into bed that night.\nWhen he woke up late the next day, he noticed the sun so bright in the sky again. A perfect day for playing, he thought to himself. Then he remembered! It was the day of the big fishing competition! He loved the fishing competition. Last year he’d won a prize. He’d better get his boat sorted out. He found it where he’d left it after his last trip. It was full of old leaves because he hadn’t covered it over properly. It took him quite a while to tidy it up. Luckily Lucas came by as he was finishing and helped him drag it down to the water. All his friends were there with their smart looking boats glistening in the sun.\n“Morris, we thought you wouldn’t make it!” said Rose the rhino. “The competition is about to start. You did check your boat for leaks didn’t you?” “Oh no, I forgot! Will you help me?” “I’ll do it with you tomorrow Morris. I’ve got to go line up now,” and off she went. Morris checked over his boat. He saw three tiny holes. He stuffed them with old leaves scrunched up in mud.\nAs he was finishing the starting buzzer went off and all the motors of the boats zoomed into life. Everyone took off to their favourite fishing spot. Morris pulled on his motor cord. It coughed and spluttered, but wouldn’t start, no matter how hard he tried. So he took out his oars. He could make it to his nearby fishing spot by\nrowing. When he got there he picked up his fishing rod. It was all tangled up — and he didn’t have any bait.\nHenry the hippopotamus came past in his boat. He’d already caught a huge fish and was taking it back to be weighed. “Can you help me Henry?” called Morris. “My lines all tangled and I’ve no bait.” “I’ll help you tomorrow Morris,” came Henry’s reply. “I’ve got to get back. Here’s some bait though.” He passed him a small packet before motoring off as fast as a big hippopotamus in a small boat could. It took Morris ages to untangle his lines. He was concentrating so hard that he didn’t notice the water slowly leaking into the bottom of his boat until he’d finished. It was only then that he realised his feet were covered in water!\n“Oh no,” he groaned. “I better start bailing out the water.” He looked around for his bucket, but it wasn’t there.\nZach the zebra motored over to him. “Please help me Zach,” called Morris. “I’m taking on some water.” Zach looked into his boat. “You’ll be all right, I can’t stop now. I’ll help you fix the leak tomorrow. Here’s my bucket though.”\nOff zoomed Zach. Morris bucketed and bucketed. He had nearly got rid of all the water when all of a sudden the hole burst and turned into a gaping mouth gushing water faster than Morris could bail it out. He was about to sink so he tightened the straps on his life jacket, stood up and jumped into the water. Brrr, it sure was cold! He rolled over onto his back and starting to kick himself back to land. Suddenly he heard Lucas calling out to him, and then there he was in a dinghy, reaching out\nto help him up.\n“I thought you didn’t like the water?” gasped Morris. “I don’t, but I saw you jump out of your boat through my binoculars, and I knew that rescuing you was the one job I couldn’t wait till tomorrow to do.” Morris shook his head sadly. “I think there are lots of jobs I won’t be leaving till tomorrow from now on.”\nCopyright © Karen Cossey"
